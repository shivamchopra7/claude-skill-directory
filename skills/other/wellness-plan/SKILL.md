name: wellness-plan
description: "Build a preventive-care (wellness) plan for a pet by species, breed, and life stage. Use when asked to create a wellness plan, plan preventive care, set up a vaccination/parasite schedule, or advise an owner on routine care for a puppy/kitten/adult/senior pet. Produces a life-stage-appropriate schedule — vaccinations, parasite prevention, dental, nutrition, screening diagnostics, and behavioral guidance — with the rationale, so an owner sees preventive care as a plan, not a series of surprise visits."

# Wellness Plan Skill

Most pet owners only see the vet when something's wrong — and miss the cheap, preventable problems that become expensive, serious ones. This skill lays out a life-stage wellness plan so the owner knows what care their pet needs, when, and why: the shots, the parasite prevention, the dental, the screenings that catch disease early.

## Working from a brief

Given the pet, **produce the full plan** — tailor to species, breed predispositions, and life stage, and note that specifics (vaccine cores/non-cores, parasite risk) vary by region and lifestyle and should be confirmed with the attending veterinarian. Do not present this as a substitute for an exam.

## Required Inputs

Ask for (if not provided, else infer and label):
- **Species, breed, age/life stage**, and rough **location/lifestyle** (indoor/outdoor, travel, other pets)
- **Current status** — known vaccines, spay/neuter, existing conditions
- **Owner priorities/constraints** if any (budget, first-time owner)

## Output Format

### Life stage & what it means
Puppy/kitten · adult · senior — the care priorities that shift with each, and any breed-specific predispositions to watch.

### Preventive-care schedule

| Area | Recommendation | Timing / frequency | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vaccinations | core + lifestyle-based non-core | series / boosters | |
| Parasite prevention | heartworm, flea/tick, deworming | | |
| Dental | home care + professional cleaning | | |
| Nutrition & weight | diet for life stage, body-condition target | | |
| Screening diagnostics | baseline/senior bloodwork, etc. | | |
| Spay/neuter | if applicable | | |
| Behavior | socialization, training, enrichment | | |

### The rationale
Short, plain "why this matters" for the owner — especially the preventable-becomes-serious cases (heartworm, dental disease, obesity, early kidney disease).

### The year ahead
A simple timeline of the next 12 months' visits/actions so it reads as a plan, with a note that the vet will tailor it at the exam.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] The plan is tailored to species, breed predispositions, and life stage
- [ ] It covers vaccines, parasite prevention, dental, nutrition, screening, and behavior
- [ ] Each recommendation has a timing and a plain-language rationale
- [ ] Regional/lifestyle variation and the need to confirm with the vet are noted
- [ ] It's framed as a proactive plan (a 12-month view), not a one-off list
- [ ] It doesn't present as a substitute for a physical exam

## Anti-Patterns

- A generic schedule that ignores species, breed, and region
- Vaccine/parasite specifics stated as universal when they vary by locale and lifestyle
- Skipping dental, weight, and behavior (the commonly-neglected pillars)
- No rationale, so the owner sees cost without understanding value
- Positioning it as a replacement for a veterinary exam
