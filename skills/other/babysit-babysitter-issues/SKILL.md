# Babysit Babysitter Issues

Fetch open GitHub issues from https://github.com/a5c-ai/babysitter/issues assigned to `a5c-agent`, then orchestrate work on each issue via `/babysitter:call`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Assigned Issues

Use the `gh` CLI to list open issues assigned to `a5c-agent`:

```bash
gh issue list --repo a5c-ai/babysitter --assignee a5c-agent --state open --json number,title,url,labels --limit 50
```

If no issues are found, report that there are no open issues assigned to `a5c-agent` and stop.

### Step 2: Present Issues

Display the list of open issues to the user with their number, title, labels, and URL. 

### Step 3: Orchestrate via Babysitter

For each issue, invoke the `babysitter:yolo` skill with a prompt that includes the issue URL and context:

```
/babysitter:yolo work on this GitHub issue: <issue_url>
```

If multiple issues are selected, process them sequentially -- complete one before starting the next. Present a summary after each issue is processed. as part of the process, create a new branch from staging named `issue-<number>` and push commits to that branch. then create a pull request against staging with a meaningful name and a description of the work done (with link to the original issue). if the issue has a "bug" label, prioritize fixing the bug and include details about the bug and how it was fixed in the pull request description.

### Step 4: Summary

After all open a5c-assigned issues have been processed, provide a summary of what was done for each issue.

## Notes

- Only issues assigned to `a5c-agent` are fetched. Other assignees are ignored.
- The `gh` CLI must be authenticated. If authentication fails, prompt the user to run `gh auth login`.
- Each issue is handed off to `/babysitter:yolo` which handles the actual implementation work.
- the entire workflow should be without any user interaction or breakpoints in the run, allowing for a seamless babysitting experience. do not let the user select which issues to work on -- just process all open a5c-assigned issues sequentially.
