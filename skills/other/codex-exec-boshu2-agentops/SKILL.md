# Codex Exec — one-shot runtime adapter

Run exactly one caller-supplied Codex prompt and capture its result. This skill
does not choose work, retry failures, validate by itself, or control continuation.

One prompt, one process, one captured artifact is what makes the run auditable:
when nothing loops, every byte of output traces to exactly one invocation, and
a disagreement about what happened is settled by the artifact.

Named failure mode — **stdin hang**: a non-TTY run left waiting forever on an
open stdin nobody will write to; always pipe the prompt or close the stream.

Anti-pattern: granting workspace-write or network access "in case the prompt
needs it". Corrective: match the sandbox to the declared effects; a review
prompt runs read-only, full stop.

## Procedure

1. Confirm `codex login status` for the intended profile.
2. Set the working root explicitly with `-C`.
3. Match the sandbox to the requested effects: read-only for offline review,
   workspace-write for authorized edits, and broader access only when the caller
   explicitly requires network or external effects.
4. Pipe the prompt to stdin (or close stdin) in non-TTY execution so the process
   cannot wait indefinitely for input.
5. Capture the final response with `-o`, JSONL, or an output schema.
6. Report the process exit status and captured artifact, then stop.

A nonzero process exit is runtime evidence, not a semantic verdict. The caller
decides whether to launch another invocation.

## Example

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$PROMPT" | codex exec -C "$WORKSPACE" -s read-only \
  -o "$OUTPUT" -
```

For a validator, the prompt must name the acceptance digest, exact subject
manifest digest, author context ID, evidence, and required checked/not-checked
report. The validator context ID must be distinct from the author's before a
`PASS` verdict is possible. When the caller elects a cross-model fresh
validator, record model identities per
the `agent-native` model-dispatch recipe and match the sandbox to
declared effects.
