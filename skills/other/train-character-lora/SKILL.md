description: Train a character/identity LoRA locally on FLUX.1-dev via the comfyui-mcp train_* tools (GPU Docker + ostris ai-toolkit). Use when the user wants to train a LoRA of a person/character from their photos on the local GPU — covers dataset prep, launch, monitoring, and using the result in ComfyUI. For WAN/Z-Image training via the ai-toolkit UI see ai-toolkit-trainer.

# Train a Character LoRA (local, Flux.1-dev)

## Overview

The trainer runs **ostris ai-toolkit's `run.py` inside a headless GPU Docker container**,
driven entirely through `train_*` MCP tools — you (the LLM) are the UI. You generate the
dataset, launch the job, watch progress, and the finished LoRA lands in ComfyUI
`models/loras/` + the LoRA catalog automatically.

- Base model: **FLUX.1-dev** (best proven character consistency; needs ~24GB VRAM with
  quantization — RTX 4090 class).
- Phase-1 scope: **character LoRAs only**. Style/slider/edit and other bases come later.

## The flow (tool sequence)

1. **`train_doctor`** — preflight once per session. Checks docker daemon, `--gpus all`
   GPU passthrough, trainer image, HF_TOKEN. If `image:false` → run **`train_build_image`**
   (one-time, several minutes — CUDA + torch + ai-toolkit). If `hfTokenSet:false`, warn the
   user: the first run downloads FLUX.1-dev (gated HF repo) and needs `HF_TOKEN` in the MCP
   server env.
2. **`train_prepare_dataset`** — stage the images. See "Dataset" below.
3. **`train_start`** — launch. Returns a job id immediately; training runs detached.
4. **`train_status {id}`** — poll progress (`progress.step/totalSteps/loss`, recent
   `samples`, `log` tail). Poll on a slow cadence (every few minutes) — a 2000-step run is
   roughly an hour on a 4090. Don't block on it.
5. **Done** — `status:"completed"` means the `.safetensors` was copied to
   `models/loras/<name>.safetensors` and upserted into the LoRA catalog (`result` has the
   paths + catalog id). Verify by loading it in a Flux workflow (`LoraLoaderModelOnly`,
   strength 1.0) with the trigger word in the prompt.

## Dataset guidance

Call `train_prepare_dataset` with `items: [{path, caption?}, ...]` and a `defaultCaption`.

- **10–30 varied images** of the subject: different angles, expressions, lighting,
  backgrounds, distances (close-up + half-body + full-body). Variety beats count.
- **Trigger word**: pick something rare and stable (e.g. `ohwx`, `zxc_person`) — NOT a
  real word. Use it as `defaultCaption` and pass it as `trigger` to `train_start`.
- **Captions**: describe what *changes* between images (pose, setting, clothing,
  expression); the constant identity is learned from the images themselves. Start each
  caption with the trigger word, e.g. `ohwx person sitting in a cafe, laughing, natural
  light`. Keep them short and factual. When in doubt, the trigger word alone
  (`defaultCaption`) is a workable baseline.
- Images are copied and renamed `img_00001.<ext>` etc. — source files are never modified.

## Params (sane defaults — override sparingly)

| Param | Default | When to change |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| steps | 2000 | 200 for a smoke test; 1500–3000 real runs. More ≠ better (overbake = plasticky). |
| lr | 1e-4 | 5e-5 for a tighter/subtler identity. |
| rank | 16 | 32 for very detailed characters. |
| resolution | [512,768,1024] | [512] if VRAM-constrained. |
| quantize | true | Keep true on 24GB. |
| saveEvery / sampleEvery | 250 | Lower (100) to watch early progress. |

## Monitoring & judgement

- `train_status.progress.samples` are host paths — **look at them**. (ai-toolkit prints no
  saved-sample lines, so they populate at finalize from the output dir; mid-run you can look
  directly in the job's `output/<name>/samples/` folder.) Identity should be
  recognizable by ~1/3 of the run; if samples stay generic past halfway, the run will
  likely underfit — cancel (`train_cancel`) and check captions/trigger.
- Loss should trend down and stabilize (~0.1–0.3); wild spikes usually mean lr too high.
- Checkpoints save every `saveEvery` steps under the job's `output/` dir, so a cancelled
  run isn't a total loss.

## Failure modes

- **`no_docker` / `no_image` from train_start** → run `train_doctor`, follow its hints.
- **OOM / CUDA errors in the log tail** → drop `resolution` to `[512]`, keep `quantize:true`,
  batch stays 1.
- **`handoff failed` in job error** → training itself finished; the LoRA is still under the
  job's `output/<name>/` dir — copy it into `models/loras/` manually and upsert the catalog.
- **First run is slow before step 1** — FLUX.1-dev download (~24GB) + latent caching. As
  long as the log tail moves, it's fine. The HF cache persists across runs.
