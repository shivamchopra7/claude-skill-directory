# Google Search Console

Read `../shared/operating-contract.md`. Use the live NotFair Search Console MCP at `https://notfair.co/api/mcp/google_search_console` as the source of truth. For a full-site SEO audit that also needs crawling and on-page analysis, hand off to `/notfair:seo-analysis` after confirming access.

## Select the exact property

1. Resolve `~~search-console` to the actual Search Console connector and inspect its current tools. Call `listProperties` or the equivalent harmless read before selecting a site.
2. Use the exact verified property form returned by the connector: `sc-domain:example.com` and `https://example.com/` are different properties.
3. Define the search type, complete date window, comparison window, dimensions, and business question. If the connector is missing or unauthorized, provide the endpoint/setup path and stop before claiming live data.

## Analyze organic performance

Use `runScript` for correlated read-only work across totals, queries, pages, countries, and devices. Batch related Search Analytics requests in one script when possible. Use specialized reads for a single report, property list, one URL inspection, or sitemap inventory.

- Query totals without the `query` dimension when reconciling property-level clicks and impressions. Anonymized low-volume queries make query rows incomplete by design.
- Finalized data normally lags recent dates; label fresh `all` data as provisional.
- Show clicks, impressions, CTR, and average position with their exact dimensions and period. Do not average already-aggregated CTR or position rows naively.
- Respect row and historical coverage limits reported by the connector. State when the result is top rows rather than a complete export.
- Use URL inspection selectively because its quota is tighter than Search Analytics. Inspection reports index state; it does not request indexing.
- Treat ranking movement as evidence, not proof of a specific algorithmic cause.

Lead with the largest material gain or loss, affected queries/pages, evidence-backed hypothesis, confidence, and the next SEO action. Route content rewrites, technical remediation, or full audits to the corresponding SEO skill.

## Manage sitemaps safely

Use dedicated `submitSitemap` or `deleteSitemap` tools only after showing the exact verified property and sitemap URL and obtaining approval. Confirm the sitemap belongs to the selected property and is fetchable before submission when possible.

Submission and deletion are reversible counterparts, but deleting a submitted sitemap does not remove its URLs from Google's index. Never describe sitemap submission as an indexing guarantee. Confirm the resulting sitemap state from returned before/after evidence or a fresh list.
