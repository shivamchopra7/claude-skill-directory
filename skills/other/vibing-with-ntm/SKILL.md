# Vibing With NTM

> **The One Rule:** Observe real state before every nudge. A swarm is not stuck, done, or blocked until pane truth, robot state, work graph, and artifact/git evidence agree.

This skill is the **operator layer above the tools** — the decisions, ticks, nudges, and recoveries an orchestrator performs. It deliberately does NOT re-document the `ntm` command surface: the binary self-describes via `ntm --help` and `ntm robot-docs` (and the `/ntm` skill catalogs it). Always re-query those for syntax, flags, and schemas; come back here for *when* to act and *when* to stop.

## Outcome — When a Tending Session Has Delivered

A tending session is complete (for now) when **all** of the following hold:

- Every pane is in one of three explicit states: **making progress** (recent useful output / git / bead movement), **explicitly blocked** with a logged blocker and handoff path, or **standing down** by policy (queue-dry, convergence, rate-limit cool-down). "Idle and you don't know why" is unfinished tending work.
- Every intervention was **observed to land** via tail/event/git/br/mail evidence within one observation window. Sends with no downstream signal are presumed lost, not silently successful.
- Any policy lever you adjusted (review-only, rate-limit posture, ensemble set) is **logged** — undocumented policy changes are how swarms drift.
- For convergence: the **triple-check** has fired — ready queue empty AND no in-flight work AND no expected upstream signals. Two of three is observation lag, not convergence.
- For queue-dry: you have **stopped manufacturing work**. Tending discipline includes the discipline of doing nothing.

If you send the same nudge twice without movement, the failure has escalated past nudging — go to [RECOVERY.md](references/RECOVERY.md), don't keep nudging.

## Grounding — Where Operator Truth Lives

Ground every decision in observable artifacts, never in agent self-report:

- **Pane truth:** `ntm --robot-tail`. What the agent says is a hypothesis; what the pane shows is data.
- **Work graph:** `br ready --json`, `br show <id> --json`. The tracker is canonical; a disagreeing agent is wrong.
- **Mail / coordination:** the Agent Mail inbox and threads — the thread is the source.
- **Git state:** `git log --since=`, `git status` on project worktrees — ground truth for "is real work being produced."
- **Snapshot deltas:** two `--robot-snapshot` outputs N seconds apart. The diff is what changed; everything else is narrative.

If a grounding source and a self-report disagree, the artifact wins.

## The Tick Loop (Mandatory)

```
1. BASELINE    -> ntm --robot-snapshot; capture cursor + sources/degraded_sources
2. ATTEND      -> ntm --robot-attention / --robot-wait; read only actionable deltas
3. CLASSIFY    -> match one OC card or AP red flag; no card means observe more
4. SCORE       -> choose the smallest reversible intervention with highest action score
5. ACT         -> one targeted send/assign/lock/restart/review instruction; never blanket-nudge
6. VERIFY      -> tail/event/git/br/mail/pipeline state changed; otherwise escalate one rung
7. STOP CHECK  -> convergence triple-check or queue-dry; stop instead of manufacturing work
8. LOG         -> record blocker, degraded source, or handoff when the loop changes policy
```

If you cannot name the phase you are in and the evidence behind it, do not nudge — re-observe.

**Cold start:** run one bounded tick (`--robot-snapshot` → tail suspect panes → match exactly one decision-tree branch → act on one pane or lever → verify). Do not read every reference first; wait on the attention feed instead of inventing work.

## Liveness Truth Stack (what to believe, in order)

Before acting on any "pane is stuck / rate-limited / done / idle" judgment, verify in this order — each layer catches lies from the one above:

1. **`tmux list-panes … -F '#{pane_current_command} #{pane_pid}'`** — is the agent CLI even running? Silent exits back to zsh are invisible to `--robot-tail`. (OC-026)
2. **`tmux capture-pane -p -S -20`** — ground truth for transient state; `--robot-tail` can sample stale buffer content for several ticks. (AP-41)
3. **`git log --since='15 minutes ago'` + `pgrep -af cargo|rustc|go|bun`** — are commits landing, are builds running? Timer labels like "Cogitated for 35m" are display artifacts, not activity. (AP-42)
4. **`ntm --robot-is-working` / `--robot-health-oauth`** — provider-side state (rate-limit, context, quota).
5. **`ntm --robot-snapshot | jq '{sources, degraded_sources}'`** — data-source freshness before acting on any derived state.

If any two layers disagree, resync before acting. See [OBSERVABILITY.md](references/OBSERVABILITY.md) → "Liveness Signals That Can Lie" for the full catalog.

## Intervention Discipline

Two gates before any state-changing action:

1. **Score it:** `Score = (Evidence × Impact × Reversibility) / BlastRadius`, each 1–5. Only act on Score ≥ 2.0; below that, wait on the attention feed or gather better evidence.
2. **Proof-card it:** evidence, card matched, target, expected state change, reversibility, verification command, next escalation rung. No proof card → no nudge, restart, force-release, or shutdown.

The full scoring matrix with worked examples, the proof-card template, the swarm-pathology trigger table, the three pattern tiers (low-risk tending → directed recovery → session policy changes), the red-flag-phrase classifier, recovery shortcuts, and the troubleshooting table all live in [DECISION-AIDS.md](references/DECISION-AIDS.md).

## Orchestrator Decision Tree

Run one tick. Pick the FIRST branch whose condition fires.

```
Is CURSOR expired (or missing)?
  → ntm --robot-snapshot  (resync, get new cursor); continue next tick.

Is ANY pane rate_limited?  (check via --robot-health-oauth, NOT pane buffer text)
  → OC-001/OC-002 in OPERATOR-CARDS.md: ping-probe first; rotate or switch account
    only if the limit is confirmed provider-side.

Is ANY pane stuck (identical tail ≥3 ticks, zero output growth)?
  → Climb the stuck-pane ladder (OC-003):
    wake-ping → C-u + send → smart-restart → hard-kill → restart-pane → add+kill.

Is there prose-without-commits? (pane is_working=true but git log 1h=0)
  → Dispatch OC-004 Ship-or-Surface prompt (PROMPTS.md).

Is context >85% on any pane?
  → Dispatch handoff-then-restart (OC-009).

Is there a file-reservation conflict or coordinator-reported collision?
  → Force-release too-broad patterns (OC-008); mediate via bead status-flip (OC-015).

Does convergence triple-check hold?
  ( git log 1h=0 AND br ready=0 AND in-flight unchanged ≥2 ticks AND convergence language in every pane )
  → STOP. Do not nudge. Exit the loop; report final state.

Otherwise — one specific-terse nudge per genuinely-idle pane (OC-010). Then wait.
```

Every card (OC-###) and anti-pattern (AP-###) is documented with recipe, prompt module, and validator in [OPERATOR-CARDS.md](references/OPERATOR-CARDS.md) and [ANTI-PATTERNS.md](references/ANTI-PATTERNS.md).

## Command Surfaces (do not re-learn from here)

- **Agents use robot surfaces** (`--robot-snapshot`, `--robot-attention`, `--robot-send`, `--robot-smart-restart`, …); interactive TUIs (`ntm dashboard`, `palette`, `view`) are for humans. The authoritative catalog is `ntm robot-docs` / `ntm --help` — re-query it; see [ROBOT-MODE.md](references/ROBOT-MODE.md) for lanes, transports, and deprecations.
- **Marching orders:** copy-paste dispatch prompts (first dispatch, steady-state, wide-swarm domain assignment, review dispatch) live in [PROMPTS.md](references/PROMPTS.md); the fill-in template is [assets/marching-orders-template.md](https://github.com/boshu2/agentops/blob/main/skills/vibing-with-ntm/assets/marching-orders-template.md). Keep one constraint live: first dispatch claims one scoped item and reserves files/worktree scope; steady-state asks for one commit or one explicit blocker per timebox.
- **Isolation:** default is Agent Mail file reservations + clear bead ownership; `--worktrees` when repo policy allows. Repo-local `AGENTS.md` always wins.
- **Pending-input etiquette:** a pane's input box may hold staged-but-unsent text. Submit it ONLY if it is clearly an orchestrator-staged directive awaiting send. NEVER submit text that reads as the human's live composition — when in doubt, leave it and log the observation.
- **Destructive dialogs:** decline by default; require explicit justification to accept.

## Cadence And Stop Conditions

Tick every 4 minutes during nucleation, 10–17 minutes in steady state, 30 minutes when panes are deep in real work. Stop tending when the convergence triple-check holds across repeated observations. If the queue is dry, do not manufacture tasks — report state, blockers, degraded sources, and residual risk. If coordination surfaces degrade, continue with explicit bead ownership and backfill mail later.

## Review-Only Mode

When the swarm audits rather than implements, flip panes to review-only: no Agent Mail registration, no bead claims, read recent diffs, tag findings by severity, rotate reviewers through study → fresh-eyes → cross-review → continuation passes, kill+relaunch between rounds. Full spec (phase cycle, mixed-swarm ratios, kill-relaunch rhythm, quality rubric, mode-switch prompts) is in [REVIEW-MODE.md](references/REVIEW-MODE.md); Gemini-specific tuning is the `code-review-gemini-swarm-with-ntm` skill.

## Metrics You Report

At closeout, summarize the swarm in concrete deltas:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Commits landed | real work, not pane chatter |
| Beads closed / opened | backlog burn vs review inflation |
| In-flight unchanged ticks | convergence/stall signal |
| Pane interventions | nudges, restarts, rotations, force-releases |
| Degraded sources | mail/CASS/beads/RCH/tool health that shaped decisions |
| Queue state | ready, blocked-only, queue-dry, or active |
| Residual risk | unverified tests, stale locks, partial runs, open blockers |

## Checklist Before Ending A Tending Turn

- [ ] No command sessions needed for the user's request are still running.
- [ ] Active panes are working, blocked with a named blocker, or intentionally stopped.
- [ ] `br ready` / `ntm work queue-dry` state is known.
- [ ] Reservations and Agent Mail state are not silently stale.
- [ ] Any restart/force-release/shutdown has evidence and a verification result.
- [ ] Closeout names commits/beads/tests/blockers, not "the swarm seems fine."

## When To Use / When To Skip

**Use when:** you are the orchestrator of an NTM session with ≥2 panes — unsticking panes, rotating accounts, dispatching marching orders, switching implement↔review modes, judging convergence, or diagnosing cross-session contention.

**Skip when:** you just need the `ntm` command catalog (`/ntm`), single-agent one-pane work, new-machine provisioning (`provision-new-machine`), Beads DB repair (`fixing-beads-problems`), or Gemini review tuning (`code-review-gemini-swarm-with-ntm`). MCP Agent Mail primitives are `/agent-mail`; bead mechanics are `/beads-br`; BV triage is `/beads-bv`; account management is `/account-rotation`.

**Degrees of freedom:** this is a medium-freedom methodology skill — prefer the specific OC/AP card when evidence fires its trigger; fall back to the decision tree otherwise. Following steps without the evidence their triggers require is worse than skipping the card.
