memU integrates with a host agent through two seams: **record** (a scheduled
bridging task mines your session log into durable memory) and **inject** (a
standing instruction in your instruction file makes you retrieve before
answering). Each supported host has its own adapter binary carrying its own
install guide. Your job here is three steps: install the package, pick your
binary, print and follow its guide.

## Step 1 — install the package

```
pip install memu-cli
```

This puts `memu` and every host-adapter binary on `PATH`. If `pip` is not the
right tool for this machine (managed Python, uv-only), use the equivalent —
what matters is that the binaries below resolve from a bare, non-interactive
shell.

## Step 2 — pick your host binary

Identify **which agent you are** (not which agents are installed — the one
executing this skill):

| You are | Your binary |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `memu-codex` |
| Claude Code | `memu-claude-code` |
| Cursor (Agent/CLI) | `memu-cursor` |
| OpenClaw | `memu-openclaw` |
| Hermes Agent | `memu-hermes` |
| anything else | `memu-agent` |

Unsure, or not in the table? You are `memu-agent`. Run:

```
memu-agent detect
```

It probes this machine and reports, per agent, whether **memorization** works
(a recognizable session log exists) and whether **retrieval** works (an
instruction file exists to patch) — and it will redirect you to a dedicated
binary if your host turns out to have one.

## Step 3 — print your guide and follow it

```
<your-binary> docs install
```

Read what it prints, top to bottom, and follow it exactly. Every guide has the
same shape — configure the store once in `~/.memu/config.env`, register the
scheduled bridging task (record), patch your instruction file (inject) — and
every part ends with a **verify gate**; do not proceed past a failing one.

Two rules that hold for every host:

- **One store.** If `~/.memu/config.env` already exists (another agent on this
  machine is already integrated), reuse it as is. A second store would split
  the embedding space and both installs would silently retrieve nothing from
  each other.
- **Report the outcome.** When done, tell the user which seams are now active —
  memorization, retrieval, or both — and where (the session log being mined,
  the instruction file patched). For `memu-agent`, the detect report decides
  this; a retrieval-only integration is a valid outcome to report, not a
  failure to hide.
