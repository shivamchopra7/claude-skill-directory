description: Gary Vaynerchuk's jab-jab-jab-right-hook framework applied to a personal portfolio rotation on X and LinkedIn. Jabs = build-in-public + educational (value). Hooks = promo (the ask). Each property in the user's configured portfolio (see `~/.config/makerskills/jab-hook/properties.yaml`) gets a hook at least once every ~3 weeks; jabs fill the rest. Drafts go into the user's Typefully workspace via MCP. Modes — plan (7-day plan), pick-next (single post), audit (coverage report), draft (specific post). Triggers on "/jab-hook," "what should I post," "plan my socials," "next promo," "next jab," "next hook," "social rotation," "promote [property]," "BIP post," "audit my socials," "what haven't I posted about."

# /jab-hook — Jab-jab-jab-right-hook for a personal portfolio

Gary Vaynerchuk's framework applied to your configured portfolio: keep the feed mostly *jabs* (value — BIP + educational) so the *hooks* (promo) earn attention when they land. Drafts to your personal Typefully workspace.

**One-time setup**: see `references/properties.md` and `references/typefully-config.md` to configure your real portfolio + workspace. Personal config lives in `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/jab-hook/`.

## Mental model

- **N rotation slots** (configured in `~/.config/makerskills/jab-hook/properties.yaml`): one per property you want to promote on rotation
- **~2 promo posts/week** → each property cycles every ~3 weeks at equal weight
- **Non-promo days**: 50/50 build-in-public vs educational
- **Target weekly rhythm**: ~2 promo + ~2–3 BIP + ~2–3 educational
- **Platforms**: X + LinkedIn via your personal Typefully workspace

## Step 1 — Pick the mode

Detect from the trigger:

| User says | Mode |
|---|---|
| "plan my socials," "next week's posts" | **plan** |
| "what should I post," "next promo," "pick next" | **pick-next** |
| "audit my socials," "what's overdue," "what haven't I posted about" | **audit** |
| "draft a promo for X," "BIP post about Y," "educational about Z" | **draft** |

If ambiguous, confirm.

## Step 2 — Load context

1. Read `references/properties.md` — the 6 rotation slots and angle ideas
2. Read `references/voice.md` — the user's voice rules per platform
3. Read `references/content-types.md` — templates for promo / BIP / educational
4. Pull recent posts from your personal Typefully workspace:
   - First run: call `mcp__typefully__typefully_list_social_sets` and ask which social set is your personal (X + LinkedIn). Save the ID to `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/jab-hook/typefully.yaml` for future runs (schema in `references/typefully-config.example.yaml` — never save it inside the skill folder; upgrades wipe it).
   - Call `mcp__typefully__typefully_list_drafts` filtered to the last 30 days
   - Classify each as promo / BIP / educational by content
5. Compute **days since last promo** for each of the 6 slots

## Step 3 — Mode logic

### plan (7-day plan)
- Slot the 1–2 most overdue properties as **promo** posts
- Fill remaining 5 days with **alternating** BIP and educational (50/50)
- Output as a table: `Day | Type | Property/Topic | Hook | Draft summary`
- Don't stack two promo on consecutive days
- After the user approves the plan, offer to draft each one in sequence

### pick-next
- Identify the most overdue property
- If most overdue < 14 days, suggest a BIP or educational instead (whichever is less recent)
- Draft 1 post; ask before syndicating

### audit
- Report: days since last promo per property, ordered by most overdue
- Flag any property >21 days as overdue
- Suggest the next 1–2 moves

### draft
- Skip rotation logic — draft the requested post
- Use the right content-type template

## Step 4 — Draft

Follow `references/voice.md` and `references/content-types.md`. Default: **single post**, one per platform (X version + LinkedIn version). Thread only if the second post earns its place.

**Link placement (load-bearing)**: never put a URL in the body. Default is no link at all — let curiosity drive the click. When a link is needed, draft it as a **first comment** for LinkedIn (Typefully supports auto-comment) or a **reply** for X. The body always stands alone.

### Optional: inspiration scan

For `promo` and `educational` posts, optionally scan inspiration accounts (`references/inspiration.md`) before drafting:

1. Pick 1–2 accounts whose audience overlaps with the property
2. Pull recent posts (agent-browser if it works on LinkedIn; otherwise ask the user to paste examples or fall back to their X/newsletter)
3. Extract structural patterns: hook openers, post length, line-break rhythm, CTA styles
4. Apply ONE pattern to the user's voice — never mimic phrasing
5. Log new patterns in `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/jab-hook/patterns.local.md` (create if missing) so they accumulate — `references/patterns.md` documents the starter patterns and stays read-only

Skip inspiration scan when the user says "just draft it" or when iterating on an existing post.

## Step 5 — Syndicate to Typefully

Ask: *"Push to Typefully now? (X + LinkedIn, your personal workspace)"*

If yes:
1. Read social set ID from `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/jab-hook/typefully.yaml` (setup notes in `references/typefully-config.md`)
2. Call `mcp__typefully__typefully_create_draft` once for X, once for LinkedIn (or once with both platforms if the social set spans both)
3. If the draft has a first-comment link, configure Typefully to add it automatically (LinkedIn auto-comment / X reply). If the MCP doesn't support auto-comment for one of the platforms, surface the comment text so the user can paste it after publishing.
4. Default to **draft** state (not scheduled) — the user reviews in Typefully UI before sending
5. Return the Typefully draft URLs

## Composes with

- `paste` — clean output for pasting into Typefully / LinkedIn / X manually if the MCP path doesn't fit
- `social-fetch` — pull inspiration-account posts for structural analysis (replaces inline agent-browser)
- `second-brain` — the `Content Ideas` wiki page hoppers hooks, frameworks, stories; `/jab-hook` drafts pull candidates from there
- `deep-research` — when a promo needs a stat or citation the draft doesn't have yet
- `marketingskills:social` — generic social frameworks, useful when teaching strategy vs shipping your own posts
- `marketingskills:copywriting` — for hook / headline ideation when stuck

## Notes on quality

- **1 promo per week per property is the floor, not the ceiling.** Rotation compounds when it's predictable — 4 properties × 1 promo/week = 4 promo weeks/month. Educational + BIP + community fill the rest.
- **Never mimic phrasing from inspiration accounts.** Extract *structure* (hook opener type, line-break rhythm, CTA style) and apply to your own voice. Voice is the moat; copying phrasing destroys it.
- **Links belong in first comments, not the body** for LinkedIn + X. Documented in `~/.claude/memory/feedback_social_link_placement.md`. Body posts with inline URLs get algorithm-suppressed on both platforms.
- **Draft state, not scheduled state.** Every Typefully push defaults to draft — human review in the Typefully UI before publish is non-negotiable. Automated scheduling of unreviewed drafts has repeatedly produced posts the user regrets.
- **Reader-perspective framing.** *"You'll know X"* not *"we'll teach you X."* *"What you're guaranteed"* not *"what we'd guarantee."*
- **Voice.local.md overrides the shipped voice.md.** Personal voice rules never live in the public repo — always in `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/jab-hook/voice.local.md`.
- **Cadence cap: 2 posts/day per platform, per account.** More than that degrades reach + reads as spam.

## Memory references

- `~/.claude/memory/feedback_promo_voice.md` (if present) — conviction-coded CTAs + reader-perspective framing
- `~/.claude/memory/feedback_social_cadence.md` (if present) — cadence cap (e.g., 2 posts/day per platform)
