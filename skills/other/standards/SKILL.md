# Standards — focused engineering guidance

Load the smallest set of standards justified by the caller's files, language,
and risks. Do not preload the entire reference corpus.

## Procedure

1. Record the supplied paths, language, change type, and risk cues.
2. Load `common-standards.md` plus only the matching language or checklist
   references.
3. Compare the supplied artifact to those sources.
4. Return cited findings with path and line when possible, plus checked and
   not-checked scope.
5. Stop.

This skill provides context and findings. It does not edit, validate, retry,
approve, commit, release, deliver, or decide continuation.
