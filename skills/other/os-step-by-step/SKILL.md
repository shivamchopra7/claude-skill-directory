name: os-step-by-step
description: >-
  ALWAYS invoke this skill when you need the user to act - run a command,
  paste a secret, click, approve - and whenever they ask how to do something
  or say they do not know what to do: "step by step", "walk me through it",
  "what do I do", "what should I do", "I don't understand what to do",
  "explain what I need to do", in any language. Picking which task comes next
  is os-whats-next; this skill is for doing the thing in front of you. First
  earn the ask: try it yourself, find another route, shrink it to the part
  only they can do. Then one action per step, commands labelled by what they
  touch, no jargon. Commands are single lines that prompt for any value -
  typing hidden for secrets - and confirm in plain words. Afterwards verify
  their step.

# os-step-by-step

The user is not stuck because the task is hard - they cannot tell what they
are being asked to do. This skill turns "I need something from you" into an
instruction a person who does not read code can follow without a follow-up
question. `os-done-or-not` reports *that* something is needed; this one says
exactly *how*.

## Language

Write in the language the user speaks in this session, detected from the
conversation. Commands, file names and identifiers stay English.

## When to use

Triggers live in the description above - any moment you need the user's hands,
or they ask what to do.

## Step 0 - earn the right to ask

Every ask costs the user a context switch. Prove it is necessary; stop at the
first item that clears the block:

1. **Try it.** A real 403 is a finding; "I probably lack permission" is a guess.
2. **Find another route.** Another tool, a value already on the host, a file
   you can read.
3. **Shrink the ask.** Obtain what you can yourself; hand over only the
   irreducible part.
4. **Check you are not asking twice** - search the session and the reports
   folder first.

Three walls where asking IS the correct move, never to be worked around:
pulling a secret into your own context, loosening a guard that is there on
purpose, doing what the user said only they do.

## The shape

Always this order - the ask first, never after the diagnosis.

```
**What I need from you: <one sentence, plain words>.**

Why you and not me: <one or two sentences. A real reason, in human terms.>

**Step 1. <action in three to six words>**
<What to do. One action only.>

**Step 2. <action>**
<...>

**How you'll know it worked.**
<What the user will see. What to do if they see something else.>

**What happens next, on my side.**
<One line: what you do once they are done, and what you will say.>
```

## After they act - verify, do not trust

"Done" is a claim. Run the one quickest check that would fail if the step had
not worked - the file exists with the right owner, the service answers, the
value works once. Never print a secret to confirm it: confirm its effect. If
the check fails, give only the corrected step - never the whole list again.
Verified versus assumed is exactly what `os-done-or-not` needs for "yes"
versus "not checked".

## Secrets and dangerous steps

A secret never goes through the chat - it would stay in the history and the
logs. The command below puts it where it belongs directly; say who deletes it
and when. A hard-to-undo step - live users, money, deletion - gets its own
warning line before the command.

**Writing a secret to a remote host** - one line: it prompts, hides the
typing, refuses a truncated paste, confirms by size:

```bash
printf 'Paste the connection string, then press Enter: '; IFS= read -rs V; echo; if [ ${#V} -lt 20 ]; then echo "Only ${#V} characters - that looks truncated, nothing was saved."; else printf '%s' "$V" | ssh root@HOST 'umask 077 && cat > /path/to/secret' && ssh root@HOST 'echo "Saved, $(wc -c < /path/to/secret) bytes"'; fi; unset V
```

**Typed by hand rather than pasted** - ask twice; a typo in a hidden field is
otherwise undetectable:

```bash
printf 'Enter the token: '; IFS= read -rs A; echo; printf 'Enter it again: '; IFS= read -rs B; echo; if [ "$A" != "$B" ]; then echo "The two entries differ - nothing saved, run it again."; else printf '%s' "$A" | (umask 077; cat > /path/to/secret) && echo "Saved, $(wc -c < /path/to/secret) bytes"; fi; unset A B
```

Two properties the templates cannot keep for you, both measured:

- **`printf …; IFS= read -rs VAR` - never `read -rsp`.** In zsh `-p` means
  "read from a coprocess": the variable comes back empty with no error and the
  secret file is written blank. macOS defaults to zsh.
- **The value never appears in the command itself** - only piped from the
  variable; anything in the arguments lands in shell history and the process
  list.

The rest the templates already embody - one single line, `umask 077` before
writing, refuse short input, confirm by byte count never by content, `unset`
at the end. Adapt the prompt, the threshold and the path; keep every property.

**The same pattern serves any value the user must supply by hand** - a public
key, a domain, an address, an id. Prompt for it the same way; keep the typing
visible when the value is not secret (drop `-s`), skip the length gate when
short is valid - and always end with a plain-words confirmation of what just
happened, so pressing Enter never feels like dropping a coin into a well.

## Choices, not instructions

A *decision* gets no steps. Use the native picker with the pack's contract:
plain question, why it matters, what changes later, easy to undo, two to four
options, the recommended one first and marked. Where the picker is not
available, write the same content as plain text.

## Hard rules

1. **The ask goes first.** What you tried and what failed is your problem -
   one line at the end, or nothing.
2. **One action per step.** Two commands is two steps.
3. **Label every command with what it touches** - the test server, the live
   server, their own machine. Look-alike steps on different targets: say what
   happens if they are swapped.
4. **A command is self-contained.** One line the user pastes and runs; if it
   needs a value, it asks for it. Never input redirection, heredocs, Ctrl-D.
5. **No jargon inside a step.** Avoid terms instead of explaining them: write
   what the person sees and clicks. One unavoidable term may stay - without a
   lecture.
6. **Always give a way to check.** A step the user cannot verify is a step
   they will redo out of doubt.
7. **Never mix your work with theirs.** Two lists with plain headings; a
   buried "this one's on you" is not an instruction.
8. **Never compress a multi-step sequence** - here brevity causes misreads.
   Blocks of two to three sentences; longer gets skimmed, and a skimmed step
   is a missed step.

## Known gotchas

- A heading is not a summary: "one command per host" above two commands reads
  as one command. Count out loud.
- A dropped step is "skip step 3" - never a silent renumber.
- If you can verify it yourself, verify it yourself; do not ask for
  confirmation you do not need.
- "Say done" needs a subject - the user may have three of your requests open.
