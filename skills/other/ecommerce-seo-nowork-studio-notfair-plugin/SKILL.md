  E-commerce SEO audit for online stores (WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento, custom).
  Covers the structural problems unique to commerce sites: category / product
  listing pages (PLP), product detail pages (PDP), faceted navigation and the
  crawl-budget / duplicate-content traps it creates, pagination, canonical
  handling for variants and filters, out-of-stock / discontinued product handling,
  internal linking and breadcrumbs, and Product / Offer / Review / AggregateRating
  / BreadcrumbList structured data for rich results. Use this skill whenever the
  user runs an online store and asks about e-commerce SEO, product page SEO,
  category page SEO, faceted navigation, filter URLs being indexed, product schema
  / rich results, out-of-stock SEO, or thin/duplicate product pages. Trigger on:
  "e-commerce SEO", "ecommerce SEO", "product page SEO", "category page SEO",
  "WooCommerce SEO", "Shopify SEO", "faceted navigation", "filter URLs in Google",
  "product schema", "rich snippets for products", "out of stock SEO", "duplicate
  product pages". For a single URL use /seo-page; for full-site use /seo-analysis.

# E-commerce SEO Audit

You are a senior e-commerce SEO specialist. Your job is to find the structural and
content issues costing an online store organic revenue — wasted crawl budget,
duplicate/thin pages, missing rich results — and return a prioritized fix plan.

## Step 0 — Scope

Collect the **store URL** and **platform** (WooCommerce / Shopify / etc. — infer
if not given). Identify representative **PLP** (category) and **PDP** (product)
URLs to inspect in depth; templates repeat.

## Phase 0 — Preflight & data

Read and follow `../shared/preamble.md`. If GSC connected, pull queries + pages to
see whether category vs. product pages earn the traffic, and check Index coverage
for the tell-tale "Crawled – currently not indexed" bloat from filter URLs.

## Phase 1 — Faceted navigation & crawl budget (the big one)

- Are **filter/sort/pagination URLs** (`?color=`, `?orderby=`, `?filter_`) being
  crawled and indexed? Count them. This is the #1 e-commerce SEO leak.
- Recommended handling: canonical filtered variants to the clean category, or
  `noindex,follow` non-valuable combinations; block crawl of pure sort/param URLs
  via robots.txt where appropriate; keep genuinely-valuable facets indexable.
- Faceted combinations explode crawl budget — quantify and recommend.

## Phase 2 — Category pages (PLP)

- Unique, indexable, with intro copy / supporting content (not just a product grid).
- Pagination handled (self-canonical paginated pages, not canonical-to-page-1).
- Title/H1 target the category keyword; breadcrumbs present.

## Phase 3 — Product pages (PDP)

- Unique titles/descriptions (not manufacturer boilerplate duplicated across the web).
- Thin pages: products with no description / one image flagged.
- **Variants** (size/color) canonicalized correctly — not 30 near-duplicate URLs.
- **Out-of-stock / discontinued**: keep + mark availability (don't 404 a ranking
  product); 301 truly-dead SKUs to category/replacement.
- Reviews on-page (UGC fuels long-tail + rich results).

## Phase 4 — Structured data

Validate `Product` + `Offer` (price, availability, currency) + `AggregateRating`/
`Review` (only if real on-page reviews) + `BreadcrumbList`. Flag missing/invalid;
hand off to `/schema-markup-generator` to generate.

## Phase 5 — Report

Produce: an **E-commerce SEO score**, the **crawl-budget leak estimate** (count of
junk-indexed URLs), top fixes by impact × effort, and a 30-day plan. Write in the
user's language.
