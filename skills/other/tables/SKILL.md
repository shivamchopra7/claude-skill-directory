# Table Designer

## Heritage and scope

This is an original Open Science Skills workflow for table production in social-science manuscripts. It is general — apply to descriptive tables, regression tables, balance tables, and summary tables across any method. For tables whose interpretation depends on method-specific standards, also consult the relevant sibling skill (`conjoint-design`, `conjoint-diagnostics`, `list-experiment`, `topic-modeling`, `text-classification`, `vlm-ocr-pipeline`). For end-stage QA on a finished table set, hand off to `figure-table-audit`.

Tables are for precise reading. A good table is one where the relevant comparison can be made without arithmetic, and where every number that appears in the manuscript text can be traced back to a specific cell. If readers have to do mental subtraction to recover the substantive quantity, the table is the wrong shape.

## Instructions

### 1. Decide whether the result belongs in a table at all

Tables are for reading values; figures are for seeing patterns. Use a table when:

- Readers need exact values (descriptive statistics for a sample, balance check, key effect sizes for citation).
- The comparison spans many models or specifications and a coefficient plot would be too dense.
- Regulatory or replication norms require it (CONSORT flow numbers, baseline balance).

Use a figure when the substantive claim is a *pattern* — a slope, a non-monotonicity, a difference of differences. Many regression tables in social science would be more readable as coefficient plots with a small accompanying summary table.

### 2. State the comparison and the estimand before laying out the table

Write down, in one sentence, what the table is supposed to let the reader compare. The first column or first panel should anchor that comparison. Examples:

- "Effect of treatment on turnout, baseline → with covariates → with fixed effects → preferred specification."
- "Sample means by treatment arm, with balance test."
- "AMCEs by attribute, pooled and split by partisanship."

If the comparison is not clear, the table will read as a coefficient dump.

### 3. Choose column order to match the argument

Columns should mirror how the text walks the reader through the result:

- **Regression tables**: baseline / minimal-controls → preferred specification → robustness checks. Place the preferred model in a clearly labeled column, not necessarily the rightmost; readers focus on the column that the text says is preferred.
- **Comparison tables**: control / treatment 1 / treatment 2 / contrast(s), or pre / post / difference.
- **Descriptive tables**: full sample → analytic sample → by treatment arm; or order subgroups by substantive logic, not alphabetically.
- Do not let `stargazer`/`modelsummary` defaults dictate the order if it obscures the comparison — pass models in argument order that matches the manuscript.

### 4. Group rows and structure panels

- Group covariate blocks: treatment(s) at the top, then primary moderators, then controls, then fixed-effect indicators, then fit statistics.
- Use horizontal rules (or panel breaks) to separate blocks; do not let regression output run as a flat list.
- Suppress controls in the main table when there are many — show "Controls: yes" and put the full coefficient set in SI.
- For multi-panel tables, use a clear panel header (e.g., "Panel A. Full sample / Panel B. Eligible voters only") and keep column structure identical across panels.
- Order rows within a block by substantive interest, not alphabetically — readers expect the headline coefficient first.

### 5. Pick precision and uncertainty conventions and stick to them

- Choose decimal precision based on the meaningful digit, not on what the software prints. Two decimals for proportions, three for small effects, integer counts for N.
- Be consistent across tables in the manuscript: same precision for the same quantity.
- Show uncertainty as standard errors `(in parentheses)` OR confidence intervals `[in brackets]` — pick one convention and use it everywhere. Note the convention in the table notes.
- Significance stars (`*`, `**`, `***`) are conventional but not required; if used, define thresholds in the notes consistently across tables.
- Always report N per column. Always report a fit statistic appropriate to the model (R² for OLS, pseudo-R² or log-likelihood for non-linear, ICC for multilevel).

### 6. Write self-contained titles and notes

A reader should be able to understand the table from title + notes alone. Title should name the **estimand** or **model family**, not just "Results."

Notes should specify:

- The dependent variable (and how it is coded).
- Treatment / condition coding and the omitted category.
- Controls included (or "Controls: yes; full list in SI").
- Fixed effects and clustering structure for SEs.
- Weights (and the weighting variable).
- Sample restrictions and N source.
- Significance markers (with thresholds).
- Data source and any transformations.
- For non-linear models: link function, units of coefficients (logit vs. AME).

### 7. Generate tables from code, not by hand

- Use `modelsummary`, `stargazer`, `gt`, `huxtable`, or `kable` (R); `stargazer` or `pystout` (Python); `esttab` (Stata) — whichever fits the workflow.
- Write the table-generating code so that re-running it after a model update updates the manuscript automatically. Hand-typed tables are a rich source of post-revision errors.
- Round in the formatting layer, not in the analysis — keep raw model output at full precision and round only when rendering.
- Insert exact numbers into the manuscript text using `\Sexpr{}` (knitr/Sweave), inline R/Python in Quarto, or LaTeX `\input{}` of generated `.tex` fragments. Do not retype numbers from tables into prose.

### 8. Production sanity

- Check that the compiled table fits the page (column count, font size). Wide tables should rotate (landscape) or move to SI.
- Check column alignment: numbers right-aligned or decimal-aligned, text left-aligned, headers per convention.
- Check that booktabs (`\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule`) or equivalent rules are used — no vertical rules between columns in academic tables.
- Confirm that significance stars and SE conventions are identical across tables in the manuscript.
- Confirm that the same coefficient appears with the same row label across tables (no `Treat` here and `Treatment_1` there).

## Output

When asked to design or revise a table, produce:

```
# Table Plan

Comparison: <one sentence>
Estimand / model family: <what is being estimated>
Column order: <what each column shows, why this order>
Row grouping: <treatment block / covariate block / FE / fit stats>
Precision and uncertainty: <decimals, SE vs CI, star thresholds>
Title: <names the estimand or model family>
Notes draft: <DV, coding, controls, FE, clustering, weights, N source, stars>
Reproducibility: <package, script path, output format>
Open issues: <anything that needs author input>
```

When asked to produce code, default to a `modelsummary` or `gt` script (R) or `stargazer`/`pystout` (Python), with model objects passed in the order the manuscript discusses them.

## Quality checks

- [ ] One-sentence comparison was stated before the table was laid out.
- [ ] A table is the right format (vs. a figure or coefficient plot).
- [ ] Column order mirrors the argument; preferred specification is labeled.
- [ ] Rows are grouped (treatment / covariates / FE / fit stats), not flat.
- [ ] Decimal precision and uncertainty convention are consistent.
- [ ] Title names the estimand or model family.
- [ ] Notes specify DV, coding, controls, FE, clustering, weights, N, significance markers.
- [ ] Table is generated by code; numbers in text are programmatically inserted.
- [ ] Final QA pass deferred to `figure-table-audit` once the table set is stable.
