# Codex Skill

Bridge to the **OpenAI Codex CLI** for high-reasoning tasks using `gpt-5.3-codex`.

## Features

1.  **High Reasoning**: Leverages `gpt-5.3-codex` with configurable reasoning effort (default: high).
2.  **Structured Output**: Supports JSON Schema for guaranteed output shapes.
3.  **Automatic OAuth**: Uses the existing `codex` CLI authentication.
4.  **Sandbox Aware**: Runs within the Codex sandbox policy if requested.

## Usage

### Simple Reasoning

```bash
./run.sh reason "Explain the relationship between CAPEC and ATT&CK"
```

### Structured Extraction

```bash
./run.sh extract "Find all entities in this text" --schema entities.json
```

### Direct CLI Access

```bash
# Pass prompts via stdin for complex multi-line tasks
echo "Analyze this code" | ./run.sh exec --model gpt-5.3-codex
```

## Integration with Dogpile

The `dogpile` skill uses this skill for:

1.  **Ambiguity Checks**: High-reasoning analysis of user intent.
2.  **Synthesis**: Consolidating search results from multiple sources into a coherent report.
