## Overview

Manage skills in your local repository (`~/.my-skills-collection`):

- **Add** skills (as git submodules or copied directories)
- **Remove** skills (handles both submodules and regular dirs)
- **Sync** repository and update all submodules
- **List** installed skills
- **Install** skills to AI agents (OpenCode, VSCode Copilot)

## Quick Commands

Use scripts from `scripts/` for safe, interactive operations:

### Add a skill

```bash
# As git submodule (recommended for external repos)
python scripts/add_skill.py --submodule <git-url> --name <skill-name>

# Copy from local directory
python scripts/add_skill.py --copy /path/to/skill --name <skill-name>
```

### Remove a skill

```bash
python scripts/remove_skill.py --name <skill-name>
```

### Sync repository

```bash
python scripts/sync_repo.py
```

### List installed skills

```bash
python scripts/list_skills.py
```
