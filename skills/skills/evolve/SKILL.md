# /evolve — Goal-Driven Compounding Loop

> **Cross-vendor analog:** Anthropic Managed Agents Outcomes (May 2026). Both close the loop "agent runs → grader scores against a rubric → agent retries"; AgentOps does it locally against any model.

> Measure what's wrong. Fix the worst thing. Measure again. Compound.

**V2 command surface:** keep the name `evolve`. Use `ao evolve` for the
terminal-native loop. It is the top-level operator entrypoint for
`ao rpi loop --supervisor`, preserving the old `/evolve` concept while reusing
the v2 RPI loop engine.

**Operator cadence:** post-mortem finished work, analyze the current repo state,
select or create the next highest-value work item, let `/rpi` handle research,
planning, pre-mortem, implementation, and validation, then harvest follow-ups
and repeat until a kill switch, max-cycle cap, regression breaker, or real
dormancy stops the run.

Always-on autonomous loop over `/rpi`. Work selection order:
1. **Harvested `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` work** (freshest concrete follow-up)
2. **Open ready beads work** (`bd ready`)
3. **Failing goals and directive gaps** (`ao goals measure`)
4. **Testing improvements** (missing/thin coverage, missing regression tests)
5. **Validation tightening and bug-hunt passes** (gates, audits, bug sweeps)
6. **Complexity / TODO / FIXME / drift / dead code / stale docs / stale research mining**
7. **Concrete feature suggestions** derived from repo purpose when no sharper work exists

**Work generators** that feed the selection ladder (auto-invoked, skip with `--no-lifecycle`):
- `Skill(skill="test", args="coverage")` → files with <40% coverage become queue items (Step 3.4)
- `Skill(skill="refactor", args="--sweep all --dry-run")` → functions with CC > 20 become queue items (Step 3.6)
- `Skill(skill="deps", args="audit")` → deps with CVSS >= 7.0 or 2+ major versions behind become queue items (Step 3.5)
- `Skill(skill="perf", args="profile --quick")` → perf findings become queue items when hot paths detected (Step 3.5)

**Dormancy is last resort.** Empty current queues mean "run the generator layers", not "stop". Only go dormant after the queue layers and generator layers come up empty across multiple consecutive passes.

```bash
/evolve                      # Run until kill switch, max-cycles, or real dormancy
/evolve --max-cycles=5       # Cap at 5 cycles
/evolve --dry-run            # Show what would be worked on, don't execute
/evolve --beads-only         # Skip goals measurement, work beads backlog only
/evolve --quality            # Quality-first mode: prioritize post-mortem findings
/evolve --quality --max-cycles=10  # Quality mode with cycle cap
/evolve --compile            # Mine → Defrag warmup before first cycle
/evolve --compile --max-cycles=5 # Warm knowledge base then run 5 cycles
/evolve --test-first         # Default strict-quality /rpi execution path
/evolve --no-test-first      # Explicit opt-out from test-first mode
```

## Delineation vs /dream

| Lane | Runs | Mutates code? | Mutates corpus? | Outer loop? | Budget |
|------|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| `/dream` | nightly, private local | **No** | **Yes (heavy)** | **Yes (convergence)** | wall-clock + plateau |
| `/evolve` | daytime, operator-driven | Yes (via `/rpi`) | Yes (light) | Yes | cycle cap |

Dream owns the knowledge compounding layer; `/evolve` owns the code compounding layer. Both share fitness-measurement substrate via `corpus.Compute` / `ao goals measure`. Run Dream overnight, then start each day with `/evolve` against the freshly-compounded corpus with a clean fitness baseline.

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--max-cycles=N` | unlimited | Stop after `N` completed cycles |
| `--dry-run` | off | Show planned cycle actions without executing |
| `--beads-only` | off | Skip goal measurement and run backlog-only selection |
| `--skip-baseline` | off | Skip first-run baseline snapshot |
| `--quality` | off | Prioritize harvested post-mortem findings |
| `--compile` | off | Run `ao mine` + `ao defrag` warmup before cycle 1 |
| `--test-first` | on | Pass strict-quality defaults through to `/rpi` |
| `--no-test-first` | off | Explicitly disable test-first passthrough to `/rpi` |
| `--no-lifecycle` | off | Skip lifecycle work generators in Steps 3.4-3.6 (/test, /deps, /perf, /refactor). Falls back to manual scanning. |

## Execution Steps

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

**FULLY AUTONOMOUS.** Read `references/autonomous-execution.md`. Every `/rpi` uses `--auto`. Do NOT ask the user anything. Each cycle = complete 3-phase `/rpi` run.

For broad AgentOps 3.0 domain evolution across skills, CLI, hooks, docs, tests,
beads, and knowledge, first read
[references/domain-evolution-bootstrap.md](references/domain-evolution-bootstrap.md).
It supplies the BDD/DDD/Hexagonal/TDD/XP control surface and the clean-room
skill-factory guardrails.

### Step 0: Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/evolve
ao corpus inject --query "autonomous improvement cycle" --limit 5 2>/dev/null || true
bash scripts/evolve-update-session-state.sh 2>/dev/null || true  # refresh derived idle_streak + mode_repeat_streak
```

`ao corpus inject` routes through the typed BC1 `CorpusReaderPort`
(`cli/cmd/ao/corpus_reader_adapter.go`, cycle 112 productionCorpusReader),
emitting one ranked `ports.CorpusItem` JSON record per line from
`.agents/learnings/` by default. This closes soc-y5vh.1 — Step 0 prior-knowledge
retrieval is now load-bearing on the typed port, not an untyped `ao lookup`
shell-out.

**Apply retrieved knowledge:** If learnings are returned, check each for applicability to the current improvement cycle. For applicable learnings, cite by filename and record: `ao metrics cite "<path>" --type applied 2>/dev/null || true`

**Prior-failure injection (mandatory):** read the last 3 entries of `.agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl`. For any with `gate` containing `FAIL|FAILED|BLOCKED`, extract failure-surface keywords (`registry|bats|markdown|supergate|canary|coverage|toolchain`) and search `.agents/learnings/` for matching learnings. Print the top matches before work selection. Without this read path, the loop accumulates write-only ledgers and re-derives lessons each cycle. See `references/convergence-mechanics.md` for the full recipe.

Before cycle recovery, load the repo execution profile contract when it exists. The repo execution profile is the source for repo policy; the user prompt should mostly supply mission/objective, not restate startup reads, validation bundle, tracker wrapper rules, or `definition_of_done`.

- Locate `docs/contracts/repo-execution-profile.md` and `docs/contracts/repo-execution-profile.schema.json`.
- Read the ordered `startup_reads` and bootstrap from those repo paths before selecting work.
- Cache repo `validation_commands`, `tracker_commands`, and `definition_of_done` into session state.
- If the repo execution profile is present but missing required fields, stop or downgrade with an explicit warning before cycle 1. Do not silently invent repo policy.

Then load the repo-local autodev program contract when it exists. The execution profile remains the repo bootstrap and landing-policy layer; `PROGRAM.md` or `AUTODEV.md` is the repo-local execution layer for the current improvement loop.

- Locate `PROGRAM.md` and `AUTODEV.md`. `PROGRAM.md` takes precedence.
- Read the resolved program before cycle recovery and cache `program_path`, `mutable_scope`, `immutable_scope`, `validation_commands`, `decision_policy`, and `stop_conditions` into session state.
- If the program file exists but is structurally invalid, stop or downgrade with an explicit warning before cycle 1. Do not silently ignore a broken operator contract.
- When a program contract exists, prefer work that can land wholly inside mutable scope. Do not silently widen scope around immutable files.

Recover cycle number, generator streaks, and the last claimed work item from disk (survives context compaction). Initialize `CYCLE` from `cycle-history.jsonl`, recover `IDLE_STREAK`, `GENERATOR_EMPTY_STREAK`, `LAST_SELECTED_SOURCE`, and `CLAIMED_WORK_REF` from `session-state.json`.

**Circuit breakers:** Time-based (60 min no productive work).

**Oscillation quarantine:** Pre-populate quarantine list from cycle history (scan for goals with 3+ improved-to-fail transitions). See `references/oscillation.md`.

Parse flags: `--max-cycles=N` (default unlimited), `--dry-run`, `--beads-only`, `--skip-baseline`, `--quality`, `--compile`.

Track cycle-level execution state:

```text
evolve_state = {
  cycle: <current cycle number>,
  mode: <standard|quality|beads-only>,
  test_first: <true by default; false only when --no-test-first>,
  repo_profile_path: <docs/contracts/repo-execution-profile.md or null>,
  startup_reads: <ordered repo bootstrap paths>,
  validation_commands: <ordered repo validation bundle>,
  tracker_commands: <repo tracker shell wrappers>,
  definition_of_done: <repo stop predicates>,
  program_path: <PROGRAM.md|AUTODEV.md or null>,
  program_mutable_scope: <declared mutable paths/globs>,
  program_immutable_scope: <declared immutable paths/globs>,
  program_validation_commands: <ordered program validation bundle>,
  program_decision_policy: <ordered keep/revert rules>,
  program_stop_conditions: <ordered cycle done criteria>,
  generator_empty_streak: <consecutive passes where all generator layers returned nothing>,
  last_selected_source: <harvested|beads|goal|directive|testing|validation|bug-hunt|drift|feature>,
  claimed_work: <null or work reference being worked>,
  queue_refresh_count: <incremented after every /rpi cycle>
}
```

Persist `evolve_state` to `.agents/evolve/session-state.json` at each cycle boundary, after work claims, after release/finalize, and during teardown. `cycle-history.jsonl` remains the canonical cycle ledger; `session-state.json` carries resume-only state that has not yet earned a committed cycle entry. Both files are **local-only** (the nested `.agents/.gitignore` denies all paths) — record durable milestones in commit messages too. See `references/cycle-history.md` for full local-only semantics.

### Step 0.2: Compile Warmup (--compile only)

Skip if `--compile` was not passed or if `--dry-run`. Read `references/knowledge-loop-integration.md` for the full warmup procedure (mine + defrag + signal notes).

### Step 0.5: Baseline (first run only)

Skip if `--skip-baseline` or `--beads-only` or baseline already exists. Read `references/fitness-scoring.md` for the baseline capture procedure.

### Step 1: Kill Switch Check

Run at the TOP of every cycle:

```bash
CYCLE_START_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
[ -f ~/.config/evolve/KILL ] && echo "KILL: $(cat ~/.config/evolve/KILL)" && exit 0
[ -f .agents/evolve/STOP ] && echo "STOP: $(cat .agents/evolve/STOP 2>/dev/null)" && exit 0
[ -f .agents/evolve/DORMANT ] && echo "Dormant since $(head -1 .agents/evolve/DORMANT 2>/dev/null)." && exit 0
```

**Sticky dormancy:** the `DORMANT` marker is written once when the Step 3 hard-gate fires (see "Nothing found?" section). Subsequent cycles short-circuit here with zero further tool calls — no fitness measurement, no work selection, no inference burn. Operator clears it by `rm .agents/evolve/DORMANT` when new scope arrives, or by editing it to indicate why. The marker is local-only (gitignored under `.agents/`).

### Step 1.5: Healing-first classifier

Before fitness or work selection, classify the cycle: `ao ci recent --limit 1 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.Conclusion // empty'`. The command routes through the typed BC2 `CIStatusPort` (`cli/cmd/ao/ci_status_adapter.go`, cycle 117 productionCIStatus) — no inline `gh` shell-outs in the evolve hot path (soc-y5vh.2). If the last push CI was `failure`, this cycle is **restorative-only** — Step 3 selection MUST take only work that reduces CI red (bug-type harvested items, gate-failure-fix beads, or generator output typed bug). No PG4 promotions, feature additions, or new shape work allowed until CI is green. The cycle-history.jsonl `gate` field of any FAIL cycle automatically triggers this mode for cycle N+1. See `references/convergence-mechanics.md`.

**Convergence check:** evaluate the STOP predicate through the typed BC3 `ConvergenceCheckPort` — `ao loop converged --green-streak <n> --unconsumed-high-medium <n> [--fitness-baseline]` (soc-y5vh.8). It emits `{converged, ci_green_streak, unconsumed_high_medium, fitness_baseline_captured, reasons}`; branch on `.converged` instead of hand-parsing `.agents/evolve/session-convergence.json`. If `converged` is true (default criteria: CI green streak ≥ 3, outstanding HIGH+MEDIUM next-work ≤ 1, fitness baseline captured), emit teardown and DO NOT re-arm wakeup.

### Step 2: Measure Fitness

Skip if `--beads-only`. Run `scripts/evolve-measure-fitness.sh` to produce a rolling fitness snapshot at `.agents/evolve/fitness-latest.json`. Read `references/fitness-scoring.md` for the full measurement procedure, baseline capture, and post-cycle regression detection.

### Step 3: Select Work

Selection is a ladder, not a one-shot check. After every productive cycle, return to the TOP of this step and re-read the queue before considering dormancy.

When a repo-local program contract exists, apply a scope filter before Step 4:
- candidate work that clearly requires immutable-scope edits is not eligible for direct execution
- prefer harvested, beads, goals, and generated work that can plausibly land within mutable scope
- if the selected item is inherently out of scope, escalate it or convert it into durable follow-up work instead of invoking `/rpi` and hoping discovery widens scope

**Step 3.0: Scope filter — route wrong-shape work to scout-mode**

Before claiming a harvested item, gate scope vs session budget. If the work touches > 5 non-uniform files, introduces a new shape (schema field, struct field, validator rule, contract surface), is operator-level epic work, OR `PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION > 5` and the work would extend an implementation arc rather than close one — route to **scout-mode** (read + annotate the queue entry, no execution). See `references/scout-mode.md` for the procedure and `references/mechanical-batches.md` for when a >5-file batch is uniform enough to bypass.

**Metronome gate:** read `mode_repeat_streak` from `session-state.json` (kept current by `scripts/evolve-update-session-state.sh`). If `mode_repeat_streak >= 3` AND the candidate work would produce the same `mode` value as the trailing run, BLOCK selection at this rung and force a jump to the NEXT rung in the ladder. If `mode_repeat_streak >= 5`, file a `bd remember "metronome-N: <mode>"` and require operator override before continuing on that rung. See `references/metronome-gate.md` for the detection rule and the cycles 144-154 retrospective.

**Step 3.1: Harvested work first**

Read `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` and pick the highest-value unconsumed item. Prefer exact repo match, then concrete implementation work, then higher severity. Read `references/knowledge-loop-integration.md` for the claim/release protocol.

**Step 3.2: Open ready beads**

If no harvested item is ready, check `bd ready`. Pick the highest-priority unblocked issue.

**Step 3.3: Failing goals and directive gaps** (skip if `--beads-only`)

First assess directives, then goals:
- top-priority directive gap from `ao goals measure --directives`
- highest-weight failing goals (skip quarantined oscillators)
- lower-weight failing goals

This step exists even when all queued work is empty. Goals are the third source, not the stop condition.

```bash
DIRECTIVES=$(ao goals measure --directives 2>/dev/null)
FAILING=$(jq -r '.goals[] | select(.result=="fail") | .id' .agents/evolve/fitness-latest.json | head -1)
```

**Oscillation check:** Before working a failing goal, check if it has oscillated (improved-to-fail transitions >= 3 times). If so, quarantine it and try the next goal. See `references/oscillation.md` and `references/fitness-scoring.md` for the detection procedure.

**Step 3.4: Testing improvements**

When queues and goals are empty, generate concrete testing work via `/test`:

```
if --no-lifecycle is NOT set:
  Skill(skill="test", args="coverage")
  Only files with < 40% coverage become queue items (severity threshold).
```

If `/test` is unavailable or `--no-lifecycle` is set, fall back to manual scanning:
- find packages/files with thin or missing tests
- look for missing regression tests around recent bug-fix paths
- identify flaky or absent headless/runtime smokes

Convert any real finding into durable work:
- add a bead when the work needs tracked backlog ownership, or
- append a queue item under the shared next-work contract when it should flow directly back into `/rpi`

**Step 3.5: Validation tightening and bug-hunt passes**

If testing improvement generation returns nothing, run lifecycle generators then bug-hunt sweeps:

```
if --no-lifecycle is NOT set:
  a) Skill(skill="deps", args="audit")
     Only deps with CVSS >= 7.0 or 2+ major versions behind become queue items.

  b) if perf-sensitive code detected (benchmarks exist, hot path patterns):
       Skill(skill="perf", args="profile --quick")
       Convert significant perf findings to queue items.
```

If lifecycle generators return nothing or are skipped, fall back to manual sweeps:
- missing validation gates
- weak lint/contract coverage
- bug-hunt style audits for risky areas
- stale assumptions between docs, contracts, and runtime truth

Again: convert findings into beads or queue items, then immediately select the highest-priority result and continue.

**Step 3.6: Drift / hotspot / dead-code mining**

If the prior generators are empty, mine for complexity debt via `/refactor`:

```
if --no-lifecycle is NOT set:
  Skill(skill="refactor", args="--sweep all --dry-run")
  Only functions with CC > 20 become queue items (severity threshold).
```

If `/refactor` is unavailable or `--no-lifecycle` is set, fall back to manual mining:
- complexity hotspots
- stale TODO/FIXME markers
- dead code
- stale docs
- stale research
- drift between generated artifacts and source-of-truth files

Do not stop here. Normalize findings into tracked work and continue.

**Step 3.7: Feature suggestions**

If all concrete remediation layers are empty, propose one or more specific feature ideas grounded in the repo purpose, write them as durable work, and continue:
- create a bead when the feature needs review/backlog treatment
- or append a queue item with `source: "feature-suggestion"` when it is ready for the next `/rpi` cycle

**Quality mode (`--quality`)** — inverted cascade (findings before directives):

Step 3.0q: Unconsumed high-severity post-mortem findings:
```bash
HIGH=$(jq -r 'select(.consumed==false) | .items[] | select(.severity=="high") | .title' \
  .agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

Step 3.1q: Unconsumed medium-severity findings.

Step 3.2q: Open ready beads.

Step 3.3q: Emergency gates (weight >= 5) and top directive gaps.

Step 3.4q: Testing improvements.

Step 3.5q: Validation tightening / bug-hunt / drift mining.

Step 3.6q: Feature suggestions.

This inverts the standard cascade only at the top of the ladder: findings BEFORE goals and directives. It does NOT skip the generator layers.

When evolve picks a finding, claim it first in next-work.jsonl:
- Set `claim_status: "in_progress"`, `claimed_by: "evolve-quality:cycle-N"`, `claimed_at: "<timestamp>"`
- Set `consumed: true` only after the /rpi cycle and regression gate succeed
- If the /rpi cycle fails (regression), clear the claim and leave `consumed: false`

See `references/quality-mode.md` for scoring and full details.

**Nothing found?** HARD GATE — only consider dormancy after the generator layers also came up empty:

```bash
IDLE_STREAK=$(jq -r '.idle_streak // 0' .agents/evolve/session-state.json 2>/dev/null)
if [ "${GENERATOR_EMPTY_STREAK:-0}" -ge 2 ] && [ "${IDLE_STREAK:-0}" -ge 2 ]; then
  printf '%s\n%s\n%s\n' "cycle $CYCLE" "$(date -u +%FT%TZ)" "stagnation: queue+generator empty x3" \
    > .agents/evolve/DORMANT
  echo "Stagnation reached after repeated empty work + generator passes. Dormancy is the last-resort outcome."
  # go to Teardown — do NOT log another idle entry. The DORMANT marker short-circuits Step 1 next fire.
fi
```

If the work layers were empty but a generator pass has not been exhausted 3 times yet, persist the new generator streak in `session-state.json` and loop back to Step 1. Empty pre-cycle work sources are not a stop reason by themselves.

A cycle is idle only if NO work source returned actionable work and every generator layer also came up empty. A cycle that targeted an oscillating goal and skipped it counts as idle only after the remaining ladder was exhausted.

If `--dry-run`: report what would be worked on and go to Teardown.

### Step 4: Execute

Primary engine: `/rpi` for implementation-quality work (all 3 phases mandatory). `/implement` or `/crank` only when a bead has execution-ready scope.

If a repo-local `PROGRAM.md` contract is active, `/rpi` will load it automatically. `/evolve` must compose with that behavior, not bypass it:
- Do not select work that is obviously outside mutable scope.
- If a bead or goal would require edits under immutable scope, escalate it or convert it into durable follow-up work instead of launching `/rpi`.
- When work is plausibly in scope but still uncertain, let `/rpi` discovery validate the fit and surface a scope escape explicitly.

For a **harvested item, failing goal, directive gap, testing improvement, validation tightening task, bug-hunt result, drift finding, or feature suggestion**:
```
Invoke /rpi "{normalized work title}" --auto --max-cycles=1
```

For a **beads issue**:
```
Prefer: /rpi "Land {issue_id}: {title}" --auto --max-cycles=1
Fallback: /implement {issue_id}
```
Or for an epic with children: `Invoke /crank {epic_id}`.

If Step 3 created durable work instead of executing it immediately, re-enter Step 3 and let the newly-created bead item win through the normal selection order.

**Mechanical-batch hint:** when the implementation phase identifies > 20 uniform per-file edits, prefer a script (`awk`/`sed`/`for f in $candidates`) over N tool-level Edit calls. See `references/mechanical-batches.md` for the decision rule and the script-first pattern.

**Pre-flight schema check (architectural migrations):** if the selected work is a port/adapter migration that rewires an existing consumer, BEFORE invoking `/rpi`, sample two representative consumer call sites and compare field-use against the target port surface. If the consumer reads > 20% more fields than the port projects, abort the migration cycle and convert the work into a port-widening cycle instead. The phase-2 narrowness post-mortem (`docs/learnings/2026-05-13-bc-ports-narrowness-postmortem.md`) is the encoded lesson; see `references/pre-flight-schema-check.md` for the procedure.

**Operator-shape carve-out:** `AskUserQuestion` is permitted ONLY for shape decisions affecting > 50 files OR a schema/contract surface (carrier choice, struct-field shape, frontmatter-key shape). See `references/autonomous-execution.md` for the bound on this exception.

### Step 4.5: Source-surface detection (pre-gate sync)

Before invoking the regression gate, sync downstream artifacts when the staged diff touches binary or embedded surfaces:

- `cli/**/*.go` changed → `cd cli && make build && go install ./cmd/ao`
- `skills/**` or `hooks/**` changed → `cd cli && make sync-hooks`
- `skills-codex/**` changed → `bash scripts/regen-codex-hashes.sh`

Without these, the gate fails on stale-binary or embedded-drift errors that look like real regressions. See `references/gate-hygiene.md` for the detection recipe.

### Step 5: Regression Gate

After execution, run the project build+test bundle. If the repo execution profile declared `validation_commands`, run them. If a repo-local program contract exists, run its `validation_commands` too, de-duplicated and in declared order after the repo bootstrap checks. Also check `if [ -f scripts/check-wiring-closure.sh ]; then bash scripts/check-wiring-closure.sh; fi`.

Use the program contract's `decision_policy` as the first keep/revert rule set for the cycle:
- if the cycle breached immutable scope, treat it as regressed
- if program validation commands fail, treat it as regressed
- if the decision policy declares a revert rule that fired, revert before consuming claimed work or advancing the queue

Treat program `stop_conditions` as per-cycle done criteria. Do not mark claimed work consumed, completed, or productive until both the stop conditions and the regression gate pass.

If not `--beads-only`, re-measure fitness to `fitness-latest-post.json` and detect regressions. The AgentOps CLI is required for fitness measurement. Read `references/fitness-scoring.md` for the full measurement, regression detection, and revert procedure.

**Gate output parsing:** trust the structural marker `^.*Pass [0-9]+: (FAILED|BLOCKED)` over the trailing status line — the trailing line conflates blocking and advisory results. See `references/gate-hygiene.md`.

Work finalization after the regression gate: claim it first, then keep `consumed: false` until the /rpi cycle succeeds. After the cycle's `/post-mortem` finishes, immediately re-read `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` before selecting the next item. Read `references/knowledge-loop-integration.md` for full claim/release semantics.

### Step 6: Log Cycle + Commit

Two paths: productive cycles get committed, idle cycles are local-only.

**PRODUCTIVE cycles** (result is improved, regressed, or harvested): compute quality score (if `--quality`), log via `scripts/evolve-log-cycle.sh`, commit if real changes exist. See `references/quality-mode.md` for scoring.

**IDLE cycles** (nothing found even after generator layers): log via `evolve-log-cycle.sh` with `--result "unchanged"`. No git add, no commit.

**Record the XP/BDD/TDD trace.** When a cycle worked a product or goal-backed gap, pass `--trace-json` to `evolve-log-cycle.sh` (or `ao loop append`) so the cycle records the continuous-evolution kernel — goal hypothesis → selected gap → Gherkin scenario → first failing proof → red/green evidence → refactor note → validation evidence → ratchet action → goal reshape — and a reviewer can reconstruct the cycle without the transcript. A trivial one-shot cycle records a `trace.exemption_reason` instead of carrying false BDD/TDD ceremony. Trace completeness is advisory, never a gate. See `references/cycle-history.md` ("XP/BDD/TDD Evidence Trace").

### Step 7: Loop or Stop

```bash
while true; do
  # Step 1 .. Step 6
  # Stop if kill switch, max-cycles, dormancy, or CONTEXT_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED
  # Otherwise increment cycle and re-enter selection
  CYCLE=$((CYCLE + 1))
done
```

**Stop reasons (any one terminates the loop):**

1. KILL/STOP file present.
2. `--max-cycles=N` cap reached.
3. **Dormancy** — `IDLE_STREAK >= 2 AND GENERATOR_EMPTY_STREAK >= 2` (queue layers AND generator layers both empty across 3 consecutive passes).
4. **CONTEXT_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED** — `context_streak >= 2` (two consecutive cycles forced into scout-mode or harvested-as-defer because the current context is too heavy to safely execute available work). See `references/context-budget.md`.
5. Regression breaker after a revert.

**Self-perpetuation modes:** the terminal-native `ao evolve` loop and the Claude-Code-harness `ScheduleWakeup` end-of-turn pattern are duals — both drive Step 1..Step 7 repeatedly against the same persisted state. See `references/autonomous-execution.md` for the ScheduleWakeup cadence and the rule that hard stops must NOT re-arm.

Push only when productive work has accumulated:
```bash
if [ $((PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION % 5)) -eq 0 ] && [ "$PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION" -gt 0 ]; then
  git push
fi
```

### Teardown

Read `references/knowledge-loop-integration.md` for the full teardown learning extraction procedure (commit staged artifacts, run `/post-mortem`, push, report summary).

**Release-context teardown (MANDATORY when the loop ran on a release-shaped branch):**

When the current branch matches `release/*`, `v*-prep`, `v*-evolve-run`, or `v\d+\.\d+*`, the teardown report MUST NOT recommend `/release` as the next step. Instead, emit the explicit pre-release checklist below — the operator must run these AND confirm green before tagging:

```
## Pre-release checklist — REQUIRED before /release

The autonomous loop has stopped, but release-readiness gates have NOT been run
during cycles. The operator MUST run the following sequence and confirm green
before invoking /release. Do NOT skip any of these on the basis of "cycles
were green" — fast pre-push gate ≠ full pre-push gate; goals-measure ≠
release readiness.

         git diff cli/docs/COMMANDS.md   # commit if non-empty

  [ ] 2. Run the FULL pre-push gate (NOT --fast):
         bash scripts/pre-push-gate.sh

  [ ] 3. Run the release-readiness gate:
         bash scripts/ci-local-release.sh

  [ ] 4. (Recommended) Smoke /evolve with the new typed read paths if BC port
         wire-ups changed:
         /evolve --quick --max-cycles=1 --dry-run

Only after [1]–[3] pass: /release <version>

If any check fails, fix the issue, re-run all four, then ship.
```

The handoff artifact (e.g., `.agents/runs/<release>/READY-TO-TAG.md`) MUST contain this checklist verbatim, unchecked, when written by the loop. The operator checks the boxes as they complete each gate; "ready to tag" means the boxes are checked, not that the loop ran cleanly.

**Rationale:** cycles 170-183 of the v2.41-evolve-run shipped clean code, all unit/integration tests green, `ao goals measure` 0/30 failing for three consecutive cycles — but the loop never ran the full pre-push gate, `ci-local-release.sh`, or `generate-cli-reference.sh`. The latter was load-bearing (the branch removed a CLI flag). Per-cycle `--fast` is a smoke test, not release readiness. Operator caught the gap; this checklist makes it mechanical.

## Examples

**User says:** `/evolve --max-cycles=5`
**What happens:** Evolve re-enters the full selection ladder after every `/rpi` cycle and runs producer layers instead of idling on empty queues.

**User says:** `/evolve --beads-only`
**What happens:** Evolve skips goals measurement and works through `bd ready` backlog.

**User says:** `/evolve --dry-run`
**What happens:** Evolve shows what would be worked on without executing.

**User says:** `/evolve --compile`
**What happens:** Evolve runs `ao mine` + `ao defrag` at session start to surface fresh signal (orphaned research, code hotspots, oscillating goals) before the first evolve cycle. Use before a long autonomous run or after a burst of development activity.

**User says:** `/evolve`
**What happens:** See `references/examples.md` for a worked overnight flow that moves through beads -> harvested work -> goals -> testing -> bug hunt -> feature suggestion before dormancy is considered.

See `references/examples.md` for detailed walkthroughs.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Loop exits immediately | Remove `~/.config/evolve/KILL` or `.agents/evolve/STOP` |
| Stagnation after repeated empty passes | Queue layers and producer layers were empty across multiple passes — dormancy is the fallback outcome |
| `ao goals measure` hangs | Use `--timeout 30 --total-timeout 75` or `--beads-only` to skip |
| Regression gate reverts | Review reverted changes, narrow scope, re-run; claimed work items must be released back to available state |

See `references/cycle-history.md` for advanced troubleshooting.
