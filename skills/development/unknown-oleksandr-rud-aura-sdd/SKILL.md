# Research Templates

## Template Selection Mechanism

Agents can specify research type in two ways:
1. **Skill Specification**: Use `research` skill with `research_type` parameter
2. **Intent Interpretation**: System determines research type from context and questions

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Direct template specification
exec story=PROJECT-001 skill=research research_type=analytics

# System interpretation based on questions and context
exec story=PROJECT-001 skill=research  # Analyzes research_questions to determine type
```

## Template Definitions

  Analytics: data sources, analytics reports, metrics
- research_mode_analysis: |
  Analytics: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, data validation
- research_evidence_type: customer_analysis

## Template Selection Logic

### Automatic Intent Interpretation
When `research_type` is not specified, the system determines the appropriate template based on:

1. **Question Analysis**: Keywords in research_questions suggest research type
   - "validate", "measure", "quantify", "metrics" → analytics
   - "feasibility", "implementation", "technical", "architecture" → technical
   - "market", "customers", "opportunity", "sizing" → market
   - "competitors", "comparison", "positioning", "differentiation" → competitive
   - "problem", "pain points", "need", "validation", "discovery" → product-discovery

2. **Agent Role**: Each agent has default research preferences
   - product-ops → market, competitive, or product-discovery research
   - architect → technical research
   - tech-lead → technical research
   - qa → analytics or technical research

3. **Available Inputs**: Context and additional inputs indicate type
   - data_sources available → analytics
   - research_topics specified → technical
   - market_scope defined → market
   - competitor_list provided → competitive
   - customer_interviews available → product-discovery

4. **Context Clues**: Task domain and current gate suggest appropriate research
   - Discovery phase → product-discovery, market, or competitive research
   - Architecture phase → technical research
   - Implementation phase → technical or analytics research
   - Testing phase → analytics research

### Parameter Override
Agents can explicitly specify research parameters:
```bash
exec story=PROJECT-001 skill=research research_type=competitive actor=product-ops
```

### Multi-Mode Research
Complex research can span multiple modes:
```bash
exec story=PROJECT-001 skill=research research_type="market+competitive"
```

The system will execute multiple research modes and consolidate findings.
