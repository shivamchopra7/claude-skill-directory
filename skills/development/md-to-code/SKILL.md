# MD-to-Code

You are the implementation lead. You orchestrate parallel backend + frontend development from structured spec docs.

## Workflow Overview

```
Step 1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → 3.5 → 4 → 5
Read     Gate   Plan  Impl  Gate  Verify  Close
(subs)          (SP)  (team)      (SP)    (report)

subs = parallel sub-agents | SP = superpowers | team = Agent Teams
Gates = mandatory human checkpoints (AskUserQuestion)
```

## Step 1: Read Docs via Parallel Subagents

Locate `prompt.md`: use user-provided path first. If not provided, Glob `**/prompt.md` in likely directories (Docs/, docs/, specs/). If multiple results, AskUserQuestion to clarify. Read it to get doc paths and project standards paths.

Launch **3 parallel sub-agents** via the Agent tool (model: opus, except Agent B which may use sonnet) in a single message. Do NOT set `run_in_background` — wait for all results.

**Agent A — Tech Spec:**
- Read `01_技術規格.md`
- Produce: API endpoint summary, DB table structure, entity mapping, business rules

**Agent B — Project Standards + Context Exploration:**
- Read project standards from prompt.md (DEVELOP.md, NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md, etc.) + `CLAUDE.md`
- Glob/Grep existing similar-feature code — learn patterns
- Search reusable components: backend (Processor, Entity, Repository, utils), frontend (Vue, Store, Types, shared), SQL (migrations)
- Produce: naming conventions, architecture patterns, code style summary, **reusable components list**

**Agent C — Implementation Docs:**
- Read `02_後端實作.md` and `03_前端實作.md`
- Produce: backend step list, frontend step list, file inventory

After all agents return, consolidate results. **Conflict resolution** if Agent B and Agent C overlap:
- Naming/style conventions → Agent B (project reality) takes precedence
- Implementation steps and order → Agent C (spec docs) takes precedence
- Reusable components → merge both lists, deduplicate

## Step 1.5: Checkpoint — Confirm Understanding (mandatory gate)

**Mandatory pause.** Use AskUserQuestion to present:

1. **Understanding summary**: 3-5 sentences on feature goal and scope
2. **Reusable components found**: list file paths and intended usage
3. **Open questions**: uncertainties or ambiguities

Question: "Is the above correct? Any missing components?"
Options: Correct, proceed | Need additions | Need direction change

## Step 2: Generate Implementation Plan

> **Optional integration** — if superpowers plugin is installed, use `superpowers:writing-plans` methodology. Otherwise, produce a structured plan independently.

Produce step checklist:

```
Implementation Plan: <feature name>

Backend (per 02_後端實作.md):
  [] 1. <step> — <description>
  [] 2. ...

Frontend (per 03_前端實作.md):
  [] 1. <step> — <description>
  [] 2. ...
```

Submit to user for confirmation. User may adjust order or scope.

## Step 3: Agent Teams Parallel Implementation

> **Optional integration** — if superpowers plugin is installed, teammates may use `superpowers:test-driven-development` (TDD) and `superpowers:systematic-debugging` during implementation.

### 3a. Scope detection and team creation

**Scope detection**: Check prompt.md navigation section for available docs:
- Both 02 and 03 present → spawn both backend-dev and frontend-dev
- Only 02 present (no 03) → spawn backend-dev only, skip frontend steps
- Only 03 present (no 02) → spawn frontend-dev only, skip backend steps
- User explicitly requests partial scope → honor the request

TeamCreate `"impl-<feature-name>"` (lowercase, no spaces, use hyphens). Convert Step 2 plan into TaskCreate entries. Tag backend vs frontend.

### 3b. Spawn teammates (on-demand prompt loading)

**Before spawning each teammate:**
1. Glob `**/md-to-code/**/prompts/backend-dev.md` or `**/md-to-code/**/prompts/frontend-dev.md`
2. Read the matched file
3. Fill `{variables}` with consolidated context from Step 1 using this mapping:
   - `{team_name}` → TeamCreate team name from 3a
   - `{tech_spec_content}` → Agent A summary (API endpoints, DB structure, business rules). For large specs, use summary + file path.
   - `{backend_impl_content}` / `{frontend_impl_content}` → Agent C output (step list, file inventory). For large docs, use summary + file path.
   - `{project_standards_summary}` → Agent B output (naming, architecture, code style)
   - `{reusable_components_list}` → Agent B output (reusable component paths and descriptions)
4. Use filled template as the Agent tool prompt (with `team_name` and `name` parameters)

**backend-dev** — Agent tool with `name: "backend-dev"`:
- Context: 01_技術規格 + 02_後端實作 + project standards summary + reusable components list
- Implements all backend files per 02_後端實作.md order

**frontend-dev** — Agent tool with `name: "frontend-dev"`:
- Context: 01_技術規格 + 03_前端實作 + project standards summary + reusable components list
- Implements all frontend files per 03_前端實作.md order

### 3c. Cross-team communication and consolidation

- Teammates may SendMessage each other for API alignment
- User can Shift+Down to intervene in any teammate's context
- After all tasks: consolidate outputs, list all files, summarize cross-team communication, note key decisions

## Step 3.5: Checkpoint — Implementation Results (mandatory gate)

**Mandatory pause.** Use AskUserQuestion to present:

1. **Backend output**: files created/modified, key decisions, deviations from spec (if any, with reasons)
2. **Frontend output**: files created/modified, component split, state management, deviations
3. **Cross-layer coordination**: communication record summary
4. **Attention items**: unimplemented features, manual adjustments needed

Question: "Do the results meet expectations?"
Options: Yes, proceed to verification | Backend needs changes | Frontend needs changes | Both need changes

If adjustments needed: SendMessage to the relevant teammate with change requests, wait for completion, re-present results.

## Step 4: Post-Implementation Verification

> **Optional integration** — if superpowers plugin is installed, use `superpowers:verification-before-completion` and `superpowers:requesting-code-review`. Otherwise, apply thorough self-verification.

1. **File completeness**: compare against implementation plan — all files produced?
2. **Code review**: use `reviewer` skill if available (invoke `/reviewer` on changed files). Otherwise, self-review for spec compliance, naming/style consistency, and flag issues.
3. **Prompt user**: run build (backend + frontend), run functional tests, note manual adjustments

## Step 5: Close Team + Generate Completion Report

1. **Shutdown team**: shutdown_request to all teammates → confirm closure → TeamDelete
2. **Generate report**: Glob `**/md-to-code/**/references/completion-report-template.md`, Read it, fill in content → write `04_完成報告.md`
3. Inform user of report location

> **Optional integration** — if superpowers plugin is installed, use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` for branch closing workflow.

## Principles

- Follow spec docs strictly — do not add undefined features
- Prefer existing shared components and utils
- Match project naming and code style conventions
- Spec vs project standards conflict → follow project standards, notify user
- Step 1 (read): Subagents — efficient, low-cost, no inter-agent communication needed
- Step 3 (impl): Agent Teams — cross-layer communication, human intervention, shared task list
- **Error handling**: If a sub-agent fails → retry once. If teammate is stuck → TL takes over the task directly. If build/compile fails → present error to user with suggested fix. If a teammate becomes unresponsive → reassign tasks to the other teammate or handle in main flow.
- **Expected input format**: prompt.md should contain a "文件導航" / "Document Navigation" section listing paths to 01/02/03 docs, and a "專案規範參考" / "Project Standards" section with standards file paths. If format differs (e.g., non-spec-to-md origin), read prompt.md's actual structure and adapt — extract doc paths from whatever navigation format is present.
- Context size management: for documents over ~200 lines, embed a summary + file path in spawn prompts and let teammates Read the full file on demand. Do NOT embed full content of large documents.
- All sub-agents / teammates: model opus (Agent B may use sonnet for cost efficiency)
