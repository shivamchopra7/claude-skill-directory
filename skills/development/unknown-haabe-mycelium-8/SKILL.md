# Feedback Review

Single-place health check across all Mycelium feedback loops. Run periodically or when something feels off.

## Preflight: Read target canvas file(s) before any Write/Edit

**Hard rule.** Before issuing `Write` or `Edit` against any `.claude/canvas/*.yml`, use the **Read tool** on that file in this session. Claude Code's Read-before-Write check requires the `Read` tool specifically — `cat`/`head`/`grep` via Bash do NOT satisfy it. Reaching for `Write` first produces a tool error and forces a remedial Read, which costs ~14k tokens of pure ceremony at typical canvas sizes (anti-pattern #7 instance #5, 2026-05-09).

If this skill writes to multiple canvas files, Read each one first. If unsure whether a write is needed, Read first anyway — Read is cheap, the recovery loop is not.

See `CLAUDE.md` *Canvas writes — Read before Write* for the canonical rule.

## When to Use
- Weekly as part of regular practice
- When metrics aren't moving despite active work
- When the team feels busy but unproductive
- After a failed launch or unexpected regression
- When `/mycelium:diamond-assess` shows stale diamonds

## Workflow

### 1. Check Loop 1 (Immediate) Health
- How many reflexion iterations are averaging? (1 = healthy, 3 = struggling)
- Any corrections logged this session? Are they new patterns or repeats?
- Is the preflight gate catching issues, or are issues slipping through?

### 2. Check Loop 2 (Incremental) Health
- Are diamond phases progressing? Or stalled?
- Are ICE confidence scores increasing with each GIST step?
- Is the delivery journal being updated? (Empty = no incremental learning)
- Are retrospectives happening after delivery increments?

### 3. Check Loop 3 (Strategic) Health
Read canvas trend data and check cadence:
- **BVSSH**: Last assessed when? Any dimension declining? (Check `bvssh-health.yml` trend fields)
- **North Star**: Are input metrics moving? Flat for 2+ months = strategic concern.
- **Delivery metrics**: Any metric degrading? Check the product-type-appropriate canvas: `dora-metrics.yml` (software), `content-metrics.yml` (content), `ai-tool-metrics.yml` (ai_tool), `service-metrics.yml` (service).
- **Wardley Map**: Last refreshed when? Stale > 3 months = risk of strategic blind spot.
- **Corrections themes**: Are the same types of mistakes recurring? (Pattern = graduate to guardrail)

### 4. Check Loop 4 (Transformative) Health
- When was the last eval benchmark run?
- Are eval pass rates improving, stable, or declining?
- Are any skills consistently underutilized? (Check .claude/harness/decision-log.md for skill invocation patterns)
- Has the escape hatch been used? How often? (Frequent = process too heavy for context)

### 5. Regression Warning Check
From `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/engine/feedback-loops.md`, check active triggers:
- DORA declined 2+ times? -> Warn about L4/L3 regression
- Confidence stagnant 3+ steps? -> Warn about opportunity reframing
- Same correction 3+ times? -> Suggest guardrail graduation
- BVSSH Safer declining while Sooner improving? -> Flag the BVSSH anti-pattern

### 6. Goodhart's Law Check
For each active metric, verify its counter-metric:
- Deployment frequency up BUT change failure rate also up? -> False improvement
- Confidence score up BUT evidence type hasn't changed? -> Inflation
- Test coverage up BUT defect leakage unchanged? -> Meaningless tests
- Diamond velocity up BUT regression rate also up? -> Rushing through gates
- Evidence source count up BUT external evidence ratio declining? -> Internal echo chamber risk. Suggest `/mycelium:handoff` to plan external conversations.

```

## Canvas Output
Update `.claude/canvas/bvssh-health.yml` trend fields if BVSSH was assessed.
Update `.claude/canvas/dora-metrics.yml` trend fields if DORA was assessed.
Log review in `.claude/memory/product-journal.md`.
