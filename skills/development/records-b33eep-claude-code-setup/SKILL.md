## Problem

Java developers using claude-code-setup lack language-specific coding standards and best practices. Currently, context skills exist for Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Shell, but Java is notably absent despite being widely used in enterprise applications.

**What problem are we solving?**

When Claude generates or modifies Java code without Java-specific standards:
- Code lacks consistency with enterprise Java conventions (naming, package structure, error handling)
- No guidance on build tools (Maven vs Gradle) and dependency management
- Missing patterns for common frameworks (Spring Boot, Jakarta EE, Quarkus)
- No integration guidance for Java ecosystem tools (JUnit, Mockito, checkstyle, spotbugs, SonarQube)
- Inconsistent approach to logging, exception handling, and resource management

**Why does it need to be solved?**

1. **Consistency**: Java projects require strict adherence to conventions (especially in enterprise environments)
2. **Quality**: Java has specific best practices (try-with-resources, Optional, Stream API) that should be followed
3. **Ecosystem**: Java tooling (Maven/Gradle, testing, static analysis) needs to be understood and properly used
4. **Parity**: Other major languages have context skills that auto-load based on tech stack

**What happens if we do nothing?**

- Java developers get generic code without language-specific best practices
- Inconsistent code quality compared to projects using Python/TypeScript skills
- Manual corrections needed for convention violations
- Missed opportunities for modern Java features (records, sealed classes, pattern matching)
- No standardized approach to common Java challenges (dependency injection, transaction management, etc.)

## Options Considered

### Option A: Comprehensive Enterprise Java Skill
- **Approach:** Single skill covering everything from Spring Boot to Jakarta EE, Maven/Gradle, testing, security, performance
- **Pros:** Complete coverage for enterprise Java developers, addresses all common scenarios
- **Cons:** Large skill file may slow down context loading, too broad for simple Java projects

### Option B: Core Java Standards + Framework Extensions
- **Approach:** Base skill covers core Java language (naming conventions, patterns, modern Java features, basic tooling), with separate optional extension skills for Spring/Jakarta EE/Quarkus created later as needed
- **Pros:** Modular design, lightweight for simple projects, extensible for enterprise needs, clear separation of concerns
- **Cons:** More files to maintain, requires creating additional skills for full enterprise coverage

### Option C: Spring-Focused Java Skill
- **Approach:** Focus primarily on Spring Boot/Spring Framework as the dominant Java framework
- **Pros:** Matches most modern Java development, clear focus, complete coverage of Spring ecosystem
- **Cons:** Excludes Jakarta EE, Quarkus, and non-framework Java users, not universal

### Option D: Core Java Only (Like standards-shell)
- **Approach:** Pure Java language standards without framework-specific guidance
- **Pros:** Universal, framework-agnostic, clean separation of concerns, lightweight
- **Cons:** Incomplete for enterprise developers, framework patterns need to be added manually

### Decision

**Option B: Core Java Standards + Framework Extensions**

Create a focused `standards-java` skill covering core Java language conventions and best practices. Framework-specific patterns (Spring, Jakarta EE, Quarkus) and potentially build tool specifics (Maven, Gradle) will be separate extension skills created later as needed.

**Reasoning:**
- Modular approach allows lightweight base for all Java projects
- Extension skills can be added based on actual user needs
- Follows single-responsibility principle - base skill handles language, extensions handle frameworks
- Users working on simple Java projects don't load unnecessary Spring/Jakarta EE context
- Enterprise developers can combine base + framework skills for complete coverage

## Solution

### Base Skill: standards-java

Create a context skill following the established pattern of standards-python, standards-typescript, and standards-shell.

**File Location:**
- `~/.claude/skills/standards-java/SKILL.md`

**Auto-Loading:**
- Tech Stack contains: "java"
- File extensions: `.java`
- Applies to: [java, maven, gradle, junit, spring, jakarta, quarkus]

**Content Structure:**

1. **Core Principles** - Readability, maintainability, SOLID, DRY
2. **Naming Conventions** - Classes, methods, packages, constants, variables
3. **Modern Java Features** (Java 17+)
   - Records for immutable data
   - Sealed classes for restricted hierarchies
   - Pattern matching (instanceof, switch)
   - Text blocks for multi-line strings
   - Switch expressions
4. **Code Organization**
   - Package structure
   - Visibility modifiers (public, protected, package-private, private)
   - SOLID principles application
5. **Exception Handling**
   - Checked vs unchecked exceptions
   - Try-with-resources
   - Custom exception hierarchies
6. **Collections & Streams API**
   - When to use List, Set, Map
   - Stream operations and best practices
   - Collectors usage
7. **Optional & Null Handling**
   - Prefer Optional for return values
   - Null-safety patterns
8. **Testing Fundamentals**
   - JUnit 5 basics
   - Mockito for mocking
   - Test naming conventions
9. **Build Tool Awareness**
   - Maven project structure (pom.xml, src/main/java, src/test/java)
   - Gradle project structure (build.gradle, settings.gradle)
   - Dependency declaration patterns
10. **Recommended Tooling**
    - checkstyle for style checking
    - spotbugs for bug detection
    - JaCoCo for code coverage
    - Maven Enforcer / Gradle verification

**Design Decisions:**

- **No MCP Server initially**: Standards skill provides guidance without external dependencies. If documentation search or dependency analysis becomes critical, consider adding MCP later.
- **No framework specifics**: Spring, Jakarta EE, Quarkus patterns belong in separate extension skills
- **Focus on modern Java**: Recommend latest LTS (Java 21/25), document features available since Java 17+
- **Practical examples**: Include code snippets for each section (similar to standards-shell)
- **Tool integration guidance**: Reference tools but don't require them

### Future Extension Skills

These will be created later based on user needs:

1. **standards-spring** - Spring Boot, dependency injection, REST controllers, Spring Data
2. **standards-jakartaee** - CDI, JAX-RS, JPA, Jakarta EE patterns
3. **standards-quarkus** - Quarkus-specific reactive patterns, native compilation
4. **maven-expert** / **gradle-expert** - Deep build tool guidance (if needed)

### Installation Integration

**Install Script (`install.sh`):**
- Add standards-java to available skills
- No new dependencies required (jq, git already checked)

**Skill Metadata (SKILL.md front matter):**
```yaml
---
name: standards-java
description: Java coding standards for enterprise applications. Includes naming conventions, modern Java features, and recommended tooling.
type: context
applies_to: [java, maven, gradle, junit, spring, jakarta, quarkus]
---
```

**Testing:**
- Add test scenario for standards-java skill loading
- Verify auto-load on Tech Stack: "Java"
- Verify task-based loading on `.java` file edit
