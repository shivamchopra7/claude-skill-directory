# Codex Search Skill

Use OpenAI Codex CLI with web search capabilities to research current information, documentation, and solutions. This is a **read-only research** skill.

## When to Use

- User asks "what's the best library for X?"
- User needs current documentation or API references
- User wants to compare different libraries or approaches
- User has an error message and needs solutions
- User asks about best practices or security recommendations
- User wants to learn about a new technology or framework
- User needs to find tutorials or getting started guides

## Prerequisites

Verify Codex CLI is available:

```bash
codex --version  # Should display installed version
```

Ensure you have internet connectivity for web search.

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Parse the Research Need

Extract what the user wants to know:

- Specific technology or library?
- What aspect (documentation, comparison, best practices)?
- Any version requirements?
- Context from current project?

### Step 2: Gather Local Context (Optional)

Check current project context if relevant:

```bash
# Check current dependencies
cat package.json  # or requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.

# Check versions in use
npm list --depth=0  # or pip list, go list, etc.
```

### Step 3: Execute Codex Search

Run Codex with the `--search` flag for web research:

```bash
codex exec --search "Research and provide comprehensive information about: [QUERY]

Include:
1. Direct answer to the question
2. Official documentation links
3. Best practices and recommended approaches
4. Code examples with explanations
5. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
6. Alternative approaches if applicable
7. Source URLs for all information

Search context:
- Current year: 2026
- Looking for latest/current information
- Prefer official documentation over third-party sources
- Include security considerations if relevant

Do NOT make any changes - this is research only."
```

### Step 4: Present Results

Format the response with proper citations:

- **Summary**: Direct answer with key findings
- **Official Documentation**: Links to authoritative sources
- **Best Practices**: Recommendations with reasoning
- **Code Examples**: Working examples from official docs
- **Sources**: All URLs cited

## Example Queries

### Documentation Lookup

```bash
codex exec --search "Find official documentation for React hooks in 2026:

```

### Library Comparison

```bash
codex exec --search "Compare Prisma vs TypeORM vs Drizzle for TypeScript database ORMs in 2026:

- Performance benchmarks
- Community adoption
- Learning curve
- Use case recommendations
Include recent comparisons and official documentation."
```

### Error Resolution

```bash
codex exec --search "Research solutions for error: 'ECONNREFUSED' in Node.js:
- Root causes
- Common solutions
- Prevention strategies
- Related issues
Include Stack Overflow discussions and official Node.js docs."
```

### Best Practices

```bash
codex exec --search "Find current security best practices for JWT authentication in 2026:

Use official Next.js documentation."
```

## Output Format

## Best Practices

✅ **DO:**

- Always use `--search` flag for web research
- Include URLs for all sources
- Prefer official documentation over blog posts
- Verify information is current (2025-2026)
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Note when information is version-specific
- Include security considerations

❌ **DON'T:**

- Make or suggest code changes (use codex-exec for that)
- Trust outdated information (pre-2024 for fast-moving tech)
- Rely on single sources
- Present unverified information
- Skip source attribution
- Ignore official documentation

## Verification

After getting Codex's search results:

1. Verify URLs are accessible and relevant
2. Check dates on sources (prefer recent)
3. Confirm information matches official docs
4. Cross-reference conflicting information
5. Add context specific to user's project if applicable

## Source Evaluation

**Prioritize:**

- Official documentation and guides
- Official GitHub repositories
- CVE databases and security advisories
- MDN (for web standards)
- OWASP (for security)
- RFC specifications

**Verify:**

- Stack Overflow (check dates, votes)
- Reputable tech blogs
- GitHub issues
- Conference talks

**Use with caution:**

- Personal blogs (unless from known experts)
- Old tutorials (pre-2024)
- Unverified forum posts

## Error Handling

**If Codex not found:**

```
Codex CLI is not available. Ensure it's installed and in your PATH.
Install: https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/
```

**If authentication fails:**

```
Codex CLI needs authentication. Run:
codex

Then follow the prompts to sign in with ChatGPT or configure API key.
```

**If search returns no results:**

- Simplify the query
- Try alternative keywords
- Search for related concepts
- Use broader terms

**If results are outdated:**

- Explicitly request "2026" or "latest" in query
- Use WebFetch to check official docs directly
- Ask for recent comparisons

**If results conflict:**

- Search for official stance
- Check version-specific differences
- Verify dates and determine which is current

## Integration with Codebase

After gathering information:

1. **Assess applicability** to current project
2. **Check compatibility** with existing dependencies
3. **Plan implementation** steps if adopting findings
4. **Suggest testing** approach

Example:

```bash
# After researching a library, check compatibility
npm info [package]@latest peerDependencies
npm install [package]@latest --dry-run
```

- **codex-exec**: For implementing solutions found through research
- **codex-review**: For validating code quality after implementation

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific**: "What's the best React state management library for large apps?" vs "What's good for state?"
2. **Include context**: "For a Next.js 15 app with TypeScript..."
3. **Request sources**: "Include official documentation and recent comparisons"
4. **Specify timeframe**: "Current best practices in 2026"
5. **Define scope**: "Focus on security best practices"

## Use Cases

### Technology Evaluation

Research before choosing a library or framework:

```bash
codex exec --search "Evaluate GraphQL vs REST vs tRPC for TypeScript API in 2026"
```

### Migration Planning

Find migration guides and breaking changes:

```bash
codex exec --search "Find breaking changes migrating from Vue 2 to Vue 3"
```

### Security Research

Find vulnerabilities and best practices:

```bash
codex exec --search "Search for security vulnerabilities in express@4.18 CVE advisories"
```

### Learning

Get tutorials and learning resources:

```bash
codex exec --search "Find beginner-friendly TypeScript tutorial for 2026"
```

### Troubleshooting

Research error messages and solutions:

```bash
codex exec --search "Solutions for 'Module not found' error in webpack 5"
```

## Limitations

- Requires internet connectivity
- Search quality depends on available online information
- May return outdated info if not explicitly filtered
- Cannot execute or test code
- Cannot make code modifications
- Limited to publicly available information

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-Query Research

For complex research, break into focused queries:

```bash
# Query 1: Current state
codex exec --search "What is the current recommended approach for SSR in React 2026?"

# Query 2: Specific implementation
codex exec --search "Find implementation examples for React Server Components"

# Query 3: Gotchas
codex exec --search "Common problems with React Server Components and solutions"
```

### Version-Specific Research

```bash
codex exec --search "Find features specific to TypeScript 5.5:
- New features in this version
- Breaking changes from 5.4
- Migration guide
Ensure results are version-specific."
```

### Comparison Research

```bash
codex exec --search "Detailed comparison of Vite vs webpack vs Turbopack in 2026:
- Build performance benchmarks
- Developer experience
- Ecosystem and plugin support
- Production optimization
- Migration complexity from webpack
Include recent benchmarks and official documentation."
```
