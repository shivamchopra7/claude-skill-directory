## Problem

Currently, there's no comprehensive guidance for Gradle build configuration using Kotlin DSL. While `standards-java` provides basic Gradle snippets, developers need deeper knowledge for:

1. **Project Configuration**: Setting up build scripts, managing dependencies, configuring plugins, multi-module projects
2. **Plugin/Task Development**: Writing custom Gradle plugins and tasks for build automation

Gradle Kotlin DSL (`.gradle.kts`) is now the modern standard, offering type safety and better IDE support compared to Groovy DSL. However, developers often:
- Struggle with Kotlin DSL syntax differences from Groovy
- Don't know Gradle best practices (dependency management, plugin application, task configuration)
- Need guidance on structuring custom plugins and tasks
- Miss opportunities to leverage Gradle's powerful features

**Why solve this?**
- Gradle is the build tool for Java/Kotlin projects (especially Android, Kotlin Multiplatform)
- Kotlin DSL is now the recommended approach, but documentation often shows Groovy
- Custom plugins/tasks are common for build automation, but patterns aren't well documented
- Having coding standards for build scripts improves project maintainability

**What if we do nothing?**
- Developers continue using inconsistent Gradle patterns
- Build scripts remain hard to understand and maintain
- Opportunities for build automation (custom tasks) are missed
- New projects might default to Groovy DSL instead of Kotlin DSL

**Scope:** This will be a comprehensive skill (~1000-1200 lines), similar in depth to `standards-java`. It covers both everyday project configuration and advanced plugin development patterns.

## Options Considered

### Option A: Two Major Sections (Recommended)

**Structure:**
- **Section 1: Project Configuration** (70% of content)
  - Build script basics (`build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`)
  - Dependency management (configurations, version catalogs)
  - Plugin application and configuration
  - Multi-module projects
  - Gradle 9 features

- **Section 2: Plugin/Task Development** (30% of content)
  - Custom task creation with proper input/output handling
  - Extension API (configurable plugins)
  - Providers API (lazy configuration)
  - Gradle caching (build cache and configuration cache)
  - Custom plugin development patterns
  - Build logic reuse (buildSrc, convention plugins)

**Groovy DSL Coverage:**
- Kotlin DSL throughout the skill
- Dedicated "Groovy → Kotlin Migration" section at end
- Common patterns and their equivalents

**Auto-loading:**
```yaml
applies_to: [gradle]
```
- Loads when editing `.gradle.kts` or `.gradle` files
- Complements `standards-java` and `standards-kotlin`

**Pros:**
- Clear separation: configuration users vs plugin authors
- Progressive disclosure: most developers need Section 1 only
- Comprehensive coverage of Gradle 9 modern APIs
- Plugin section covers critical concepts (providers, caching, extensions)

**Cons:**
- Plugin development section substantial (but necessary)
- Might be a large skill file

### Option B: Three Separate Sections

**Structure:**
- Section 1: Essential Configuration
- Section 2: Advanced Configuration (multi-module, custom configurations)
- Section 3: Plugin/Task Development

**Pros:**
- More granular learning path

**Cons:**
- Harder to navigate
- Arbitrary split between "essential" and "advanced"
- Over-engineered for a standards skill

### Option C: Integrated Approach

**Structure:**
- Mix configuration and customization throughout
- Each topic shows both usage and extension

**Pros:**
- Shows full Gradle power

**Cons:**
- Confusing for developers who just want to configure dependencies
- Doesn't match typical usage patterns

### Decision

**Option A** - Two major sections with expanded plugin development coverage.

**Rationale:**
- Matches how developers use Gradle: most configure projects, some build plugins
- Plugin section comprehensive enough to cover modern Gradle APIs (providers, caching, extensions)
- Clear structure makes it easy to find relevant information
- Gradle 9 focus ensures modern best practices
- Groovy migration guide helps teams transitioning from legacy projects

## Solution

Create a comprehensive Gradle standards skill based on Gradle 9 LTS with Kotlin DSL as the primary syntax.

### Skill Metadata

```yaml
name: standards-gradle
description: Gradle build tool standards focusing on Kotlin DSL. Covers project configuration, dependency management, and custom plugin/task development.
type: context
applies_to: [gradle]
```

### Content Structure

```markdown
# Gradle Coding Standards (Gradle 9 LTS)

## Core Principles
- Declarative over imperative
- Type-safe configuration (Kotlin DSL)
- Lazy configuration (Providers API)
- Build cache-friendly tasks
- Configuration cache compatible

## Section 1: Project Configuration (~70% of content)

### Build Script Basics
- `build.gradle.kts` structure and organization
- `settings.gradle.kts` for multi-module projects
- Plugin application (plugins {} block)
- Repository configuration (mavenCentral, etc.)

### Dependency Management
- Dependency configurations (implementation, api, compileOnly, runtimeOnly)
- Version catalogs (libs.versions.toml) - Gradle's modern approach
- Dependency constraints and platform/BOM dependencies
- Excluding transitive dependencies

### Plugin Configuration
- Applying plugins: id() vs apply()
- Configuring plugin extensions
- Common plugins: java, kotlin-jvm, application
- Plugin versions and version catalogs integration

### Multi-Module Projects
- Project structure conventions
- Shared configuration via convention plugins
- Dependency management across modules
- buildSrc vs included builds vs composite builds

### Gradle 9 Features
- Latest LTS improvements
- Performance enhancements
- New APIs and deprecations

## Section 2: Plugin/Task Development (~30% of content)

### Custom Tasks
- Registering vs creating tasks (lazy vs eager)
- Task inputs and outputs (proper annotations for up-to-date checks)
- Task dependencies, ordering (dependsOn, finalizedBy)
- Abstract task classes with Property<T>

### Extension API
- Creating extensions for configurable plugins
- Extension properties using Property<T>
- Nested extensions for complex configuration
- Extension best practices

### Providers API
- Lazy configuration with Provider<T>
- Property<T> for mutable properties (task inputs)
- Connecting providers (map, flatMap, zip)
- Avoiding eager configuration anti-patterns

### Gradle Caching
- **Build cache**: Task output caching, cache keys
- **Configuration cache**: Build graph caching, compatibility requirements
- Writing cache-compatible tasks (avoid mutable state)
- Cache debugging and troubleshooting

### Custom Plugins
- Plugin implementation patterns (Plugin<Project>)
- Precompiled script plugins in buildSrc
- Convention plugins for shared configuration
- Composite builds for plugin development

### Build Logic Reuse
- buildSrc directory structure
- Included builds for modular build logic
- Convention plugins across projects
- Publishing plugins to repositories

## Groovy → Kotlin DSL Migration Guide

- Syntax differences (assignment vs =, strings, etc.)
- Plugin application conversion
- Dependency declaration differences
- Common patterns and idioms
- Configuration block conversions
```

### Integration Points

1. **Auto-loading**: Skill loads when editing `.gradle.kts` files (Kotlin DSL focus)
2. **Groovy DSL files**: For `.gradle` files, skill provides migration guide to Kotlin DSL; primary content is Kotlin-focused
3. **Complements**: Works alongside `standards-java` and `standards-kotlin`
4. **Framework-agnostic**: Pure Gradle concepts, no Spring Boot/Android specifics
5. **Version baseline**: All examples assume Gradle 9 LTS
6. **Version strategy**: Update in place for minor Gradle versions; evaluate new skill for major versions (e.g., Gradle 10+)

### Content Tone

- Practical examples with BAD/GOOD patterns
- Focus on modern APIs (providers, lazy configuration)
- Emphasize build performance (caching, configuration cache)
- Clear migration guidance from Groovy DSL

## Test Coverage and Validation

### What IS Tested in test-project

The test project (`skills/standards-gradle/test-project/`) validates these patterns with runnable code:

✅ **Fully Validated:**
- Plugin application (plugins {} block)
- Repository configuration
- Dependency management with version catalogs (gradle/libs.versions.toml)
- Java toolchain configuration
- Task registration (lazy vs eager)
- Custom tasks with input/output annotations
- Cacheable tasks (@CacheableTask annotation)
- Custom plugins in buildSrc
- Extension API (ExamplePlugin with ExamplePluginExtension)
- Convention plugins (java-conventions.gradle.kts)
- Provider API usage (Property<T>, Provider<T>)
- Task dependencies (dependsOn, mustRunAfter)

### What is Illustrative (Not Directly Tested)

Some examples in the skill are illustrative patterns that demonstrate concepts but aren't executed in the test project:

⚠️ **Illustrative Examples:**
- Multi-module project structure (test project is single module)
- Remote repository authentication (requires actual credentials)
- Dependency constraints and BOM usage (conceptual examples)
- Remote build cache configuration (requires remote server)
- Build services (example shows pattern, not full implementation)
- Composite builds (requires multiple separate projects)
- Provider transformations (map, flatMap, zip - shown but not extensively tested)
- Configuration cache issues (anti-patterns documented but not executed)

### E2E Test Validation

The E2E test (`tests/scenarios/17-standards-gradle.sh`) validates:

1. ✅ Skill metadata and structure
2. ✅ Required sections present
3. ✅ Installation via installer
4. ✅ **Test project actually builds** (`./gradlew build`)
5. ✅ **Custom tasks execute** (`./gradlew exampleTask`)
6. ✅ **Cacheable task works** (`./gradlew cacheableTask`)
7. ✅ **Version catalog resolves** (`./gradlew dependencies`)

### Critical Fixes Applied

Based on critical review, the following issues were fixed:

**Critical Fixes:**
1. ✅ Fixed @CacheableTask annotation pattern (was incorrectly showing nested annotation class)
2. ✅ Added working cacheable task to test project with proper @CacheableTask usage
3. ✅ Fixed ServiceReference example (replaced non-existent @ServiceReference with correct build service pattern)
4. ✅ Fixed convention plugin example (added explanation of plugin ID auto-generation)

**Quality Improvements:**
5. ✅ Added version catalog usage to test project (was only commented out)
6. ✅ Added build validation to E2E test (ensures examples compile)
7. ✅ Added BAD examples for Extension API and Build Services
8. ✅ Updated test project README with cache validation instructions
9. ✅ Documented test coverage limitations (this section)

**Content Completion:**
10. ✅ Added Gradle Build Phases section (init/config/execution phases)
    - Location: After "Build Script Basics" (line 154)
    - Content: ~500 lines explaining lifecycle, when code runs, common mistakes
    - Includes: Phase examples, anti-patterns, debugging, full lifecycle demo
    - Impact: Completes understanding of lazy evaluation and configuration cache

### Skill Size

- **Total lines:** 3,843 (larger than originally planned 1000-1200)
- **Section 1 (Project Config):** ~60% of content
- **Section 2 (Plugin/Task Dev):** ~30% of content
- **Migration Guide:** ~10% of content

**Decision:** Accept the larger size given the comprehensive coverage needed. The skill is well-structured with clear section boundaries, making it navigable despite the length.

### Validation Against Official Gradle Documentation

All examples cross-referenced with:
- Gradle 9.3 User Guide
- Kotlin DSL Primer
- Custom Tasks Guide
- Custom Plugins Guide
- Build Cache Guide
- Configuration Cache Guide

**Result:** Examples match official patterns and use correct Gradle 9 APIs.
