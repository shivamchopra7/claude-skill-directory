OVERVIEW
actor: product-ops | mandate: Update stakeholders and close story | bounds: No technical changes, communication only

ORIENTATION
Confirm .spec/constitution.md for current architecture and delivery guardrails.
Review .spec/glossary.md entries relevant to stakeholder communication to keep terminology aligned.
Load the product-ops persona brief from .spec/agents/product-ops.agent.md for format expectations.

LIFECYCLE TRANSITION
from: E2E_COMPLETE ➜ to: SYNCED
ACCEPTS_FROM: [qa-e2e]
tag: [pm.sync] (append to story ## Lifecycle Log)

WHEN TO RUN
Testing complete and stakeholder updates needed
Story closure required with delivery summary
External tracker updates needed for project management
Success metrics validation and reporting required

REQUIRED INPUTS
story_id
test_results (from qa-e2e)
delivery_metrics (performance, quality, timeline metrics)
stakeholder_list (who needs updates)
MCP tooling: [Read, Write]

CONTEXT PACK
<<story.current_state>>
<<personas.active_assignments>>
<<recent_transition_log>>
<<<GLOSSARY(term=stakeholder)>>>

EXECUTION ALGORITHM
Validate prerequisites (test_results, delivery_metrics). If anything missing → BLOCKED format below.
Collect evidence: test results, performance metrics, delivery outcomes.
Validate all success metrics have been achieved or exceeded.
Prepare stakeholder communication with delivery summary.
Document final outcomes and lessons learned.
Update external project management systems if required.
Draft gate artifact using the structure in ARTIFACT OUTPUT.
