# Commit Changes Skill

## Purpose

Create well-structured git commits following conventional commits format with project-aware module emojis. This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.

## Natural Language Triggers

This skill activates when the user says things like:
- "Commit these changes"
- "Create a commit"
- "Commit this"
- "Save my changes"
- "Make a commit for this work"
- After completing a scratchpad task: "Done with this task, commit it"

## Workflow Execution

### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)

Execute these in parallel for efficiency:

1. **Project Context:**
   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions
   - Identify current development phase/priorities

2. **Git Context:**
   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes
   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)
   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes
   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch
   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference

### Phase 2: Analyze Changes

1. **Categorize Changes:**
   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?
   - Which module(s) are affected?
   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)

2. **Staging Decision:**
   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together
   - Group logically related changes
   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit
   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first

3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**
   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work
   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files
   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included

### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message

**Format:**
```
{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}

{optional body explaining what and why}
```

**Components:**

1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md
   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis
   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs
   - Use the most specific module that applies

2. **Change Type Emoji:**
   - ✨ feat: New feature
   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix
   - 📝 docs: Documentation
   - 💄 style: Formatting/style
   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring
   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements
   - ✅ test: Tests
   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration
   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements
   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files
   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format
   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix
   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project
   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes
   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types
   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code

3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)

4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)

5. **Description:**
   - Imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - No period at end
   - Under 50 characters
   - Focus on capability/value added

6. **Body (optional):**
   - Explain what and why, not how
   - Context for the change
   - Reference issue numbers if applicable

### Phase 4: Confirm with User

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Ready to commit with this message?"
  header: "Commit"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, commit"
      description: "Create the commit with this message"
    - label: "Edit message"
      description: "I want to modify the commit message"
    - label: "Stage more files"
      description: "I need to include additional files"
    - label: "Cancel"
      description: "Don't commit right now"
```

Display the proposed commit message clearly before asking.

### Phase 5: Execute Commit

1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   ```

2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}

   {body if present}
   EOF
   )"
   ```

3. **Confirm success:**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --oneline
   ```

### Phase 6: Report Result

Display:
```
✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}

📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-

🌿 Branch: {branch-name}
```

## Smart Staging Logic

When unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:

1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically
2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:
   ```
   question: "Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?"
   options:
     - "Module A changes (3 files)"
     - "Module B changes (2 files)"
     - "All changes together"
     - "Let me specify"
   ```

3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:
   - "These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits."

## Quality Checks

Before committing, verify:
- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)
- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)
- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes

## Error Handling

### Nothing to Commit
If no changes exist:
```
ℹ️ No changes to commit.
   Working tree is clean.
```

### Merge Conflicts
If conflicts exist:
```
⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.
   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.
```

### Detached HEAD
If in detached HEAD state:
```
⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.
   Consider creating a branch before committing.
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**Called by:**
- `do-work` skill - After completing each scratchpad task
- User directly via natural language

**Works with:**
- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions
- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on

## Project-Specific Adaptations

The skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:
- Module names and their emojis
- Commit message conventions (if custom)
- Scope naming patterns

**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
## Project Modules
- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints
- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components
- **database** 🗄️: Database layer
```

This skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Create atomic commits (one logical change)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Reference issues when applicable
- Stage related files together
- Use project-specific module emojis

### ❌ DON'T:
- Commit unrelated changes together
- Use vague messages like "updates" or "fixes"
- Include debugging code
- Commit secrets or credentials
- Skip the body when context is needed
- Add Claude attribution to commit messages
