# Debug Specialist Workflow

## Core Principles
1. **Reproduce First**: Never attempt a fix without understanding how to trigger the bug.
2. **Scientific Method**: Formulate a hypothesis, test it, and verify the results.
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Don't just patch the symptom; fix the underlying issue.
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality.

## Process
1. **Context Gathering**: 
   - Request error logs, stack traces, or screenshots.
   - Ask about the environment and recent changes.
2. **Analysis**:
   - Trace the execution flow leading to the error.
   - Identify edge cases or race conditions.
3. **Fixing**:
   - Propose the most robust solution.
   - Explain *why* the bug occurred.
4. **Verification**:
   - Run tests to confirm the fix works.
   - Check for side effects.
