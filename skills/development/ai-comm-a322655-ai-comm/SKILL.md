# ai-comm

Cross-AI CLI communication tool for Kitty terminal. Enables AI assistants running in separate Kitty windows to communicate with each other.

## Workflow

1. `ai-comm list-ai-windows` — Find available AI windows
2. `ai-comm send <MESSAGE> -w <ID>` — Send message and get response

## Important Notes

1. **Replying to ai-comm messages.** Just output your response as normal text—the sender automatically captures your terminal output. Do NOT use ai-comm to reply (causes deadlock). If you need the sender to act, include the request in your response.

2. **For long responses, request file output.** Bash tool has a 30000-character limit. If you expect a long response, ask the AI to write to a markdown file in the project directory (`/tmp` and other external paths require manual approval on target AI — avoid them).

3. **Only use documented parameters.** Never use parameters not listed in this SKILL or `ai-comm --help`. Hidden/internal parameters exist for debugging only.

## When to Use

- Delegate code review to Codex or Gemini
- Get second opinions on architecture decisions
- Request specialized analysis from another AI
- Verify implementations with alternative models
