# C/C++ Comprehensive Cheat Sheets (/cpp)

Complete C/C++ development reference combining local documentation with live examples from cppcheatsheet.com, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced GPU programming and system-level development.

## How It Works

When you ask C/C++ questions, I will:
1. **Fetch live examples** from https://cppcheatsheet.com/
2. **Enhance with local docs** if in the cppcheatsheet repository
3. **Provide current, comprehensive answers** from the best available sources
