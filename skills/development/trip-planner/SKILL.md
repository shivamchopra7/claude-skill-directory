Use when asked to plan a trip, build a travel itinerary, what should I do in [place], or help me plan my holiday. Produces a day-by-day plan grouped by area (so you're not criss-crossing the city), must-book-ahead flags, a packing list tuned to the trip, a rough budget range, and honest notes on pace and gaps to fill with local info."

# Trip Planner

Most trip plans fail one of two ways: a Pinterest list with no shape, or an itinerary so packed it's a forced march. This builds a real one — clustered by neighbourhood so you're not zig-zagging, paced with actual downtime, honest about what needs booking ahead, and clear about where you should check current local info rather than trust a plan.

## What This Skill Produces

- **The day-by-day itinerary** — grouped by area, with a realistic number of things per day and built-in slack
- **Book-ahead flags** — what sells out or needs reservations, and roughly how far ahead
- **A tuned packing list** — for the destination, season, and activities (not a generic list)
- **A rough budget range** — lodging / food / activities / transit, with the big swing factors named
- **Verify-locally notes** — opening hours, closures, tickets, and safety that change and must be checked near the date

## Required Inputs

Ask for these if not provided:
- **Where & when** — destination(s), dates or season, number of days
- **Who's going** — solo / couple / family with kids / friends (changes pace and picks)
- **The vibe** — relax / see-everything / food / outdoors / culture / budget-backpack vs. comfort
- **Constraints** — budget level, mobility needs, must-dos, and no-gos

## Framework: A Plan You'd Actually Enjoy

1. **Cluster geographically.** Group each day by area to cut transit time — the biggest hidden cost of a bad plan.
2. **Pace for humans.** 2–3 anchor things per day, not 7; jet lag on day one; a slow morning somewhere.
3. **Flag the bookable.** Separate "just show up" from "sold out a month ahead."
4. **Budget in ranges, honestly.** Give a band and name what moves it (season, lodging tier, eating out vs. in).
5. **Say what to verify.** Hours, seasonal closures, and safety change — mark them "check near your date," don't assert them as fixed.

## Output Format

### [Destination] · [dates/season] · [travellers] · [vibe]
**Budget band:** ~[range] — swing factors: [x].

### Day by day
**Day 1 — [area]:** morning … · afternoon … · evening … · *(built-in downtime: …)*
**Day 2 — [area]:** …

### Book ahead
- [thing] — ~[how far ahead]

### Packing (tuned)
- [items specific to season/activities]

### Verify near your date
- [hours / closures / tickets / safety to confirm]

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Each day is clustered by area to minimise back-and-forth
- [ ] Pace is realistic (downtime, jet lag, not over-stuffed)
- [ ] Book-ahead items are separated from walk-ups
- [ ] Budget is a range with the main swing factors named
- [ ] Time-sensitive facts (hours/closures/safety) are flagged "verify," not asserted as current
- [ ] Packing list is specific to the destination/season/activities

## Anti-Patterns
- **A march** — cramming every landmark into every day.
- **Zig-zag routing** that ignores geography and burns hours in transit.
- **Asserting current hours/prices/closures** as fact — flag them to verify.
- **A generic packing list** that ignores the actual climate and plans.
- **One-size pace** for a family with a toddler and a group of 20-somethings.

## Example Trigger Phrases
- "Plan a 5-day trip to Lisbon for a couple who loves food."
- "Build me a Tokyo itinerary — first time, 7 days, mid-budget."
- "What should I do in Rome in 3 days with kids?"
- "Help me plan a relaxed week in the mountains."
- "Weekend city break — give me a day-by-day and a packing list."
