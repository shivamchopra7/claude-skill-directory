# Energize Denver Proposal Generation

Generate professional Iconergy proposals for Energize Denver compliance projects including benchmarking, energy audits, compliance pathways, and performance target consulting.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Creating proposals for Energize Denver compliance services
- Responding to Energize Denver audit or benchmarking requests
- Pricing Energize Denver projects (audits, compliance consulting, benchmarking)
- Generating proposals for Building Performance Requirements compliance
- Working with Denver commercial or multifamily buildings ≥5,000 sq ft

## Quick Start

1. **Gather Building Information**:
   - Building address
   - Square footage (gross floor area)
   - Building type (commercial, multifamily, mixed-use)
   - Energize Denver Building ID (if known)
   - Current EUI and compliance status (if known)

2. **Determine Service Type**:
   - Benchmarking & Data Verification
   - Energy Audit (Level 1, 2, or 3)
   - Compliance Pathway Consulting
   - Performance Target Analysis
   - Alternate Compliance Application

3. **Generate Proposal**:
   Use `scripts/generate-proposal.py` to create customized .docx proposal

- Develop multi-year compliance strategy
- ECM recommendations to meet performance targets
- Alternate compliance pathway applications
- Typical timeline: 6-8 weeks
- Pricing: Based on building complexity and timeline

### Performance Target Analysis

  - 5,000-10,000 sf: Dec 31, 2027

### Alternate Compliance Options:
- Timing adjustments for meeting requirements
- Target adjustments for building use characteristics
- Prescriptive options for smaller buildings
- Process loads exemptions for manufacturing/agriculture

## Generating Proposals

### Using the Python Script

```bash
python .claude/skills/energize-denver-proposals/scripts/generate-proposal.py \
  --service "Benchmarking & Data Verification" \
  --building-address "5067 S Wadsworth Blvd, Denver, CO 80123" \
  --square-footage 25000 \
  --building-id 15708 \
  --pricing-model "T&M" \
  --nte 5000 \
  --contact-name "Your Name" \
  --contact-title "Your Title" \
  --contact-phone "720-555-1234" \
  --contact-email "your.email@iconergy.com" \
  --output "output-proposal.docx"
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
python .claude/skills/energize-denver-proposals/scripts/generate-proposal.py --interactive
```

The script will prompt for all required information and generate a complete proposal.
