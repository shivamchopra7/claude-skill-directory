Before making any changes for **$ARGUMENTS**, follow this process:

## 1. Find Similar Examples
- Search for existing code that does something similar
- Read at least 2 examples of the same pattern in this codebase
- Note: naming conventions, file locations, import styles, error handling

## 2. Check Conventions
- Read CLAUDE.md and any relevant .claude/rules/ files
- Look for linting config (.eslintrc, .prettierrc, ruff.toml, etc.)
- Check if there's a template or generator for this type of change

## 3. Plan the Change
- List all files that need to be created or modified
- Identify the order of changes (dependencies first)
- Note any tests that need to be added or updated

## 4. Implement
- Follow the exact patterns found in step 1
- Match naming, structure, and style exactly
- Add tests following the existing test patterns

## 5. Verify
- Run the relevant test command
- Check that no existing tests broke
- Verify the change integrates with existing code

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before presenting the result, verify:

- [ ] At least 2 similar examples were read from the codebase
- [ ] Naming matches existing conventions (casing, prefixes, suffixes)
- [ ] File location follows existing project structure
- [ ] Import style matches the codebase (relative vs absolute, named vs default)
- [ ] Error handling follows existing patterns (not invented new ones)
- [ ] Tests added following existing test patterns
- [ ] No unrelated changes or "while I'm here" improvements
- [ ] Linter/formatter would pass on the new code
