- Want to stay in current session
- Want automatic review checkpoints

## Two-Stage Review

1. **Spec Compliance** - Did they build what was requested? (nothing more, nothing less)
2. **Code Quality** - Is it well-built? (clean, tested, maintainable)

Spec MUST pass before quality review begins.

## Red Flags

- Never skip either review stage
- Never proceed with unfixed issues
- Never dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel
- Never let implementer self-review replace actual review

## Agents Used

- `agents/implementer/` - Fresh subagent per task
- `agents/spec-reviewer/` - Verifies spec compliance
- `agents/code-quality-reviewer/` - Verifies code quality
- `agents/code-reviewer/` - Final review of entire implementation
