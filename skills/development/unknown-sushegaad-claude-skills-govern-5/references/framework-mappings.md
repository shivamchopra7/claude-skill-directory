## CIS Controls v7.1 vs v8 Changes

Key changes to understand if transitioning from v7.1 to v8:

| Aspect | CIS Controls v7.1 | CIS Controls v8 |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Number of controls | 20 | 18 |
| Sub-controls | 171 | 153 safeguards |
| Organization | Technology type | Asset type |
| Cloud coverage | Limited | Explicit throughout |
| Mobile coverage | Limited | Integrated |
| Implementation Groups | Yes (IG1/2/3) | Yes (enhanced) |

**Controls merged/reorganized:**
- v7 Controls 4 (Controlled Use of Admin Privileges) + 16 (Account Monitoring) → v8 Control 5 (Account Management)
- v7 Controls 12 (Boundary Defense) + 13 (Data Protection) → v8 Controls 3 (Data Protection) + 12 (Network Infrastructure)
- v7 Controls 7 (Email/Web Browsers) + 8 (Malware Defenses) → v8 Controls 9 + 10

**New in v8:**
- Explicit cloud asset coverage in all applicable controls
- Service Provider Management as standalone Control 15
- Clearer Implementation Group assignments per safeguard
