# CIS Controls v8 — Implementation Guidance

## Getting Started: The Prioritization Principle

The CIS Controls are deliberately ordered by impact. Research consistently shows that implementing Controls 1–6 (the foundational six) eliminates the vast majority of cyber risk:

- **Controls 1–2** (Inventory): You can't protect what you don't know you have
- **Controls 3–6** (Protective): Prevent the most common attack paths
- **Control 7** (Vulnerability Management): Continuously reduce attack surface
- **Controls 8–18** (Detect, Respond, Recover): Build operational security capability

Start with IG1 completely before moving to IG2. IG1 is the minimum acceptable baseline for any organization.

## Common Implementation Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Skipping IG1 to implement IG2/IG3 Controls
**Problem:** Organizations try to deploy SIEM before they know what assets they have
**Solution:** Complete IG1 systematically before advancing. Asset inventory (Controls 1-2) is the foundation for everything else.

### Pitfall 2: Treating CIS Controls as a checklist, not a program
**Problem:** Point-in-time compliance; controls drift over time
**Solution:** Build operational processes: scheduled scans, monthly reporting, quarterly reviews, annual assessments

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring cloud assets
**Problem:** Cloud VMs, SaaS apps, cloud storage not included in inventory or scans
**Solution:** CIS Controls v8 explicitly addresses cloud assets — include in all inventories; use CSPM tools (Wiz, Prisma, Defender for Cloud)

### Pitfall 4: MFA deployment gaps
**Problem:** MFA enabled on some systems but not others; SMS OTP used for privileged access
**Solution:** Comprehensive MFA inventory; phishing-resistant MFA for privileged and external access

### Pitfall 5: Log collection without review
**Problem:** SIEM deployed but alerts are not actioned; logs retained but never searched
**Solution:** Define alert response procedures; staff SOC or use MDR service; weekly log review as minimum

### Pitfall 6: Patch management without vulnerability scanning
**Problem:** Patching OS only; missing application and firmware vulnerabilities
**Solution:** Authenticated vulnerability scanning to identify all missing patches, misconfigurations, and CVEs
