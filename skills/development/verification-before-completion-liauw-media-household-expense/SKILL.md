# Verification Before Completion

## Core Principle

Before declaring ANY work "complete" or "done", verify EVERYTHING works. This is the final gate before handoff.

## When to Use This Skill

- After completing `code-review` skill
- User asks "is it done?"
- **BEFORE EVERY COMMIT** (mandatory)
- Before creating pull request
- Before closing an issue
- Before marking a feature as complete

## The Iron Laws

### 1. NEVER DECLARE WORK COMPLETE WITHOUT FULL VERIFICATION

Reasons:
- Ensures nothing was forgotten
- Confirms everything actually works
- Validates against original requirements
- Prevents "one more thing" scenarios
- Professional quality gate

### 2. NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT VERIFICATION

**This skill is MANDATORY before ANY git commit.**

If you find yourself typing `git commit` without having completed this verification checklist, **STOP**.

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**
```bash
# Making changes
vim src/file.js
git add .
git commit -m "fix stuff"  # ← WRONG! No verification!
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```bash
# Making changes
vim src/file.js

# MANDATORY: Run verification-before-completion skill
# Complete ALL checklist items
# Only after FULL verification passes:

git add .
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null values in user profile"
```

**Authority**: Professional teams NEVER commit without verification. Unverified commits cause:
- 🐛 Bugs in production
- 💥 Broken builds
- 😡 Wasted team time
- 💸 Lost customer trust

### 3. FRONTEND + BACKEND = FULL TEST SUITE

**When changes affect both frontend and backend:**

MANDATORY before commit:
- ✅ Backend tests (unit + integration)
- ✅ Frontend tests (component + integration)
- ✅ E2E tests (full user flow)
- ✅ API tests (if API changed)

**Never commit if ANY test fails.**

## Verification Protocol

### Step 1: Announce Verification

**Template:**
```
I'm using the verification-before-completion skill to perform final checks before declaring this complete.
```

### Step 2: Requirements Verification

**Check against original user request:**

```
Original Request:
"[User's original request verbatim]"

Requirements Checklist:
✅ [Requirement 1] - Implemented and verified
✅ [Requirement 2] - Implemented and verified
✅ [Requirement 3] - Implemented and verified
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Did I do EVERYTHING the user asked for?
- Are there any "and also" or "oh and" requests I missed?
- Did the requirements change during discussion?
- Are there implied requirements I should have addressed?

### Step 3: Functionality Verification

**Test the complete feature end-to-end:**

```
End-to-End Testing:

Scenario 1: [Happy path]
Steps:
1. [Action 1] → ✅ Works
2. [Action 2] → ✅ Works
3. [Action 3] → ✅ Works
Result: ✅ Complete flow works

Scenario 2: [Alternative path]
Steps:
1. [Action 1] → ✅ Works
2. [Action 2] → ✅ Works
Result: ✅ Alternative flow works

Scenario 3: [Error path]
Steps:
1. [Action 1] → ✅ Appropriate error
Result: ✅ Error handling works
```

### Step 4: Test Verification

**Verify ALL tests pass:**

```
Test Verification:

Before running tests:
✅ Using database-backup skill (MANDATORY)
✅ Backup created: [filename]

Running complete test suite:
Command: ./scripts/safe-test.sh vendor/bin/paratest
Results:
- Total: [X] tests
- Passed: [X] tests
- Failed: 0 tests
- Duration: [time]
- Coverage: [X]%

✅ All tests pass

Running specific feature tests:
Command: ./scripts/safe-test.sh vendor/bin/paratest --filter=[Feature]
Results:
- Total: [Y] tests
- Passed: [Y] tests
- Failed: 0 tests

✅ Feature tests pass
```

**If ANY tests fail:**
```
❌ Tests failed - NOT ready for completion

Failed tests:
1. [Test name] - [Failure reason]
2. [Test name] - [Failure reason]

I need to fix these before declaring complete.
```

### Step 5: Integration Verification

**Verify integration with existing system:**

```
Integration Verification:

✅ No existing functionality broken
✅ API contracts maintained (backwards compatible)
✅ Database migrations applied successfully
✅ Database migrations can be rolled back
✅ No conflicts with other features
✅ Environment variables documented
✅ Dependencies up to date
```

**Run regression tests:**
```
Running full test suite to ensure nothing broke:
Command: ./scripts/safe-test.sh vendor/bin/paratest
Results: ✅ [X] tests, all passed
```

### Step 6: Documentation Verification

**Verify all documentation is complete:**

```
Documentation Checklist:

Code Documentation:
✅ PHPDoc/JSDoc comments on all public methods
✅ Complex logic has explanatory comments
✅ Type hints on all function parameters

API Documentation:

```

### Step 8: Git Verification

**Verify version control state:**

```
Git Status Check:

✅ All changes are committed
✅ Commit messages follow conventions
✅ Branch is up to date with base branch
✅ No merge conflicts
✅ .gitignore properly configured
✅ No sensitive files committed

Git log (last commits):
[Show last 3-5 commits with messages]
```

### Step 9: Deployment Verification

**Verify deployment readiness:**

```
Deployment Checklist:

✅ No breaking changes (or documented)
✅ Rollback plan exists
✅ Health check endpoints work
✅ CI/CD pipeline passes (if configured)

Migration Commands (if needed):
1. [Command 1]
2. [Command 2]

Rollback Commands (if needed):

Issues preventing completion:
1. [Critical issue 1]
2. [Critical issue 2]

I need to address these before declaring complete.
```

## Red Flags (Incomplete Work)

- ❌ "Just need to test one more thing" → Test it NOW
- ❌ "I'll document it later" → Document NOW
- ❌ Skipped tests → Fix them NOW
- ❌ "It works on my machine" → Verify in clean environment
- ❌ Uncommitted changes → Commit NOW
- ❌ "I'll fix that typo later" → Fix NOW

## Common Rationalizations to Reject

- ❌ "It's good enough" → Verify it's complete
- ❌ "The user just wants it working" → Professional quality still matters
- ❌ "I'm out of time" → Better to deliver late and complete than early and broken
- ❌ "I'll fix issues if they come up" → Fix known issues NOW
- ❌ "Documentation can wait" → Document before you forget

## Example Verifications

### Example 1: Complete Feature

```
I'm using the verification-before-completion skill for the user authentication feature.

End-to-End Testing:

Scenario 1: Registration and Login
1. POST /register with email/password → ✅ Returns 201, user created
2. POST /login with credentials → ✅ Returns token
3. GET /user (protected) with token → ✅ Returns user data

Scenario 2: Social OAuth
1. GET /auth/redirect/google → ✅ Redirects to Google
2. Callback returns with user → ✅ User created/logged in
3. Token issued → ✅ Works

Scenario 3: Protected Routes
1. GET /user without token → ✅ Returns 401
2. GET /user with invalid token → ✅ Returns 401
3. GET /user with valid token → ✅ Returns 200

Scenario 4: Error Handling
1. Register with invalid email → ✅ Returns 422 with validation errors
2. Login with wrong password → ✅ Returns 401 with clear message
3. Login with non-existent email → ✅ Returns 401 with clear message

```

### Example 2: Issues Found

```
I'm using the verification-before-completion skill for the activity logging feature.

Original Request:
"Track user activity in a database table including IP address and user agent"

Requirements Checklist:
✅ Activity logging database table
✅ Logs user registration
✅ Logs user login
✅ Logs user logout
✅ Captures IP address
✅ Captures user agent

End-to-End Testing:
✅ User registration creates log entry with IP and user agent
✅ User login creates log entry
✅ User logout creates log entry

Test Verification:

Before running tests:
✅ Using database-backup skill
✅ Backup created

Running tests:
❌ FAILED - 2 test failures

Failed tests:
1. ActivityLogTest::test_logging_includes_user_agent
   - Expected: User agent to be captured
   - Actual: user_agent column is NULL
   - Reason: ActivityLogger not capturing user agent correctly

2. ActivityLogTest::test_user_can_view_own_activity
   - Expected: GET /user/activity returns activity logs
   - Actual: 404 Not Found
   - Reason: Forgot to implement the viewing endpoint

Verification Found Issues ⚠️

Critical Issues (preventing completion):
1. User agent not being captured
   - Tests expect it, code doesn't capture it
   - Fix: Update ActivityLogger to use $request->userAgent()

2. Missing endpoint to view activity logs
   - User probably wants to see their activity
   - This is an implied requirement
   - Fix: Add GET /user/activity endpoint

I need to fix these issues before declaring complete.
```

**After fixing:**
```
Fixed issues:
✅ Updated ActivityLogger to capture user agent correctly
✅ Added GET /user/activity endpoint
✅ Added test for new endpoint
✅ All tests now pass (18 tests)

Re-running verification:
✅ All requirements met (including implied requirement)
✅ All tests pass
✅ End-to-end testing successful
✅ Documentation updated

Verification Complete ✅ - Activity logging is now complete and ready.
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**Before verification-before-completion**: Use `code-review` skill
**After verification-before-completion**: Ready to commit/deploy
**If issues found**: Fix and re-verify

## Authority

**This skill is based on**:
- Software engineering best practice: Quality gates
- Professional standard: Definition of "done"
- Agile methodology: Acceptance criteria
- Empirical evidence: Final verification catches 40% of remaining issues

**Social Proof**: Professional teams have explicit "definition of done" checklists. No code is "complete" without verification.

## Your Commitment

Before using this skill, confirm:
- [ ] I will NEVER declare work complete without verification
- [ ] I will CHECK every item in the verification checklist
- [ ] I will RUN all tests as part of verification
- [ ] I will FIX any issues found
- [ ] I will DOCUMENT verification results

---

**Bottom Line**: "Complete" means fully verified, tested, documented, and ready to deploy. Never declare done without proving it's done.
