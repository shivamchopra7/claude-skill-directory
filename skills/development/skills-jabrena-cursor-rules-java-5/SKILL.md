# Maven Best Practices

Improve Maven POM configuration using industry-standard best practices.

**Core areas:** Dependency management via `<dependencyManagement>` and BOMs, standard directory layout (`src/main/java`, `src/test/java`), centralized plugin management, build profiles for environment-specific settings, readable POM structure with version properties, explicit repository declaration, version centralization, multi-module project structure with proper inheritance, and cross-module version consistency.

**Prerequisites:** Run `./mvnw validate` or `mvn validate` before applying recommendations. If validation fails, **stop** and ask the user to fix issues—do not proceed until resolved.

**Multi-module scope:** After reading the root `pom.xml`, check for a `<modules>` section. If present, read **every** child module's `pom.xml` before making any recommendations. Check each child for hardcoded versions that duplicate parent `<dependencyManagement>`, redundant `<pluginManagement>` blocks, properties that should be centralized, and version drift across sibling modules.

**Before applying changes:** Read the reference for detailed examples, good/bad patterns, and constraints.
