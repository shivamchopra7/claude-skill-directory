## Art. 12 — Record-Keeping / Automatic Logging

**Who:** Providers must build in automatic logging capability; deployers must retain logs.

**Provider obligations:**
- High-risk systems must be capable of automatically generating event logs throughout operation
- Logging capability enables post-deployment reconstruction of circumstances surrounding risks
- For biometric identification: logs must enable identification of persons involved and circumstances

**Deployer obligations (Art. 26(6)):**
- Retain automatically generated logs for **minimum 6 months** from use, or as required by applicable Union/national law (whichever longer)
- Public sector deployers: stricter retention may apply under public records obligations

---

## Art. 13 — Transparency and Provision of Information to Deployers

**Purpose:** Enable deployers to understand and correctly use the AI system.

**System design requirement:** High-risk AI systems must be designed with sufficient transparency for deployers to interpret outputs and use appropriately.

**Instructions for use must include:**
- Provider identity, address, registration data
- System characteristics, capabilities, and intended purpose
- Performance metrics: level of accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity
- Known or foreseeable circumstances that may lead to risks
- System performance for specific persons/groups
- Specifications for input data (data types, formats, dimensions)
- Information on changes made vs prior versions
- Human oversight measures (Art. 14) and technical measures to enable oversight
- Computational resources required; expected system lifetime

## Art. 14 — Human Oversight

**Purpose:** Enable effective human monitoring during operation to identify and correct AI errors.

**System design obligations (providers, Art. 14(3)):**
High-risk AI systems must be designed to allow natural persons to:
- Understand system capabilities and limitations
- Recognize **automation bias** (over-reliance on AI outputs)
- Correctly interpret AI outputs (including interpretability features)
- Decide not to use, or disregard, override, or reverse AI outputs
- Intervene through a **stop button** or similar interrupt mechanism

**Deployer implementation obligations (Art. 14(4)):**
- Assign human oversight to natural persons with necessary competence, authority, and resources
- Train oversight persons on system capabilities/limitations and automation bias risk

**Biometric identification specific (Art. 14(5)):**
- Minimum **two separate persons** must independently verify and confirm identification before action is taken

**Proportionality:** Oversight measures are built in by providers proportionate to risks and level of autonomy; deployers may need to supplement with organizational measures.

## Art. 15 — Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity

**Accuracy:**
- System must achieve appropriate accuracy levels for intended purpose throughout its lifecycle
- Declared accuracy levels and metrics must be in instructions for use (Art. 13)
- Training, validation, and testing data must be statistically appropriate to achieve declared levels

**Robustness:**
- Resilience against errors, faults, or inconsistencies during operation and foreseeable misuse
- Consistent performance throughout operational lifetime
- Where appropriate: technical redundancy solutions, backup plans, fail-safe mechanisms
- For continuous learning systems: eliminate/reduce risks of feedback loops amplifying biased outputs

**Cybersecurity:**
Resilience against attempts to alter use, outputs, or performance, including:
- **Data poisoning attacks** (contaminating training data)
- **Model poisoning attacks** (manipulating model weights)
- **Adversarial examples** (crafted inputs causing misclassification)
- **Confidentiality attacks** (extracting training data or model internals)
- **Model flaws exploitation** (taking advantage of design weaknesses)

**Technical solutions appropriate to context:** Air-gapping sensitive components, adversarial testing, input validation, output monitoring.

## Arts. 43–49 — Conformity Assessment and CE Marking

### Art. 43 — Conformity Assessment Paths

**Annex III — Point 1 Systems (Biometrics):** Provider chooses between:
- **(A) Self-assessment** — Internal control via Annex VI procedure; OR
- **(B) Notified body** — Third-party assessment under Annex VII (QMS review + technical documentation assessment)

Notified body (B) is **mandatory** when:
- No harmonised standards covering the system exist
- Standards exist but provider has not applied them (or only partially)
- Common specifications are unavailable or not used
- Standards published with restrictions that limit presumption of conformity

**Annex III — Points 2–8 Systems (Areas 2–8):** Self-assessment only — no notified body assessment available.

**Annex I Products (safety components):** Conformity assessment integrated into the existing conformity procedure for the product under Annex I legislation.

**Law enforcement / immigration / EU institutions:** Market surveillance authority acts as notified body.

**Substantial modifications:** Require full reassessment; except predetermined learning modifications documented in original technical file and declared in conformity declaration.

### Art. 47 — EU Declaration of Conformity
- Drawn up by provider (or authorised representative); provider assumes full responsibility
- Must confirm compliance with all applicable AI Act requirements (Section 2)
- Must identify: system name, provider, version, intended purpose, conformity assessment procedure followed, standards applied
- Machine-readable format; translation required into languages required by national authorities
- Maintained for **10 years** from market placement

### Art. 48 — CE Marking
- Visible, legible, indelible affixation on system, packaging, or documentation
- Only affixed after successful conformity assessment and drawing up of EU Declaration of Conformity
- Subject to general principles of CE marking (Regulation 765/2008)
- Affixed before market placement; re-affixed if system substantially modified

### Arts. 49 and 60 — EU AI Database Registration

**Provider registration (Art. 49):**
- Before market placement (Annex III systems — Art. 6(2))
- Information includes: provider/representative identity; system description, intended purpose, accuracy; conformity assessment procedure; CE marking notified body (if applicable)
- Provider registration covers all deployers and users of that system

**Public authority deployer registration (Art. 60):**
- Before deployment of registered high-risk systems
- Additional system-specific information for public authority use

**Database operation:** Operational from 2 August 2026 (Commission responsibility, Art. 71).

**Publicly accessible information vs. restricted:** Most information public; some law enforcement/immigration information accessible only to competent authorities.

## Art. 27 — Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA)

**Who:** Public authorities and bodies deploying high-risk AI systems in Annex III Areas 1, 2, 4, 5(b–d), 6, 7, and 8.

**Content:**
- Description of the deployer's processes in which the system will be used
- Time period, frequency, and number of persons affected
- The specific categories of persons likely to be affected
