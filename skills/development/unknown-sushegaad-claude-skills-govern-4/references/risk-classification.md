## Art. 5 — Prohibited AI Practices (All 8, applies from 2 February 2025)

### 5(1)(a) — Subliminal / Manipulative Techniques
AI systems using subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness, or purposefully manipulative/deceptive techniques, that materially distort behavior and impair informed decision-making, causing or likely to cause significant harm to those persons or third parties.

### 5(1)(b) — Exploitation of Vulnerabilities
AI systems exploiting vulnerabilities of persons or groups based on age, disability, or socioeconomic circumstances, distorting behavior in a manner that causes or is likely to cause significant harm.

### 5(1)(c) — Social Scoring
AI systems that evaluate or classify natural persons or groups based on social behavior over a period of time or inferred personal characteristics, leading to:
- Detrimental or unfavorable treatment of persons or groups in unrelated social contexts; OR
- Treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified relative to the social context in which the behavior occurred

### 5(1)(d) — Predictive Criminal Risk Assessment
AI systems assessing the risk of natural persons committing criminal offenses based solely on profiling or personality/character traits assessment. **Exception:** systems supporting human assessment based on objective, verifiable facts directly linked to criminal activity.

### 5(1)(e) — Untargeted Facial Recognition Database Creation
Creating or expanding facial recognition databases through untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage.

### 5(1)(f) — Emotion Inference in Workplace or Educational Institutions
AI systems that infer emotions of natural persons in the workplace or educational institutions. **Exception:** for medical or safety purposes.

### 5(1)(g) — Biometric-Based Categorization for Sensitive Attributes
AI systems categorizing natural persons individually based on biometric data to deduce or infer race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, or sexual orientation. **Exception:** labeling/filtering of lawfully acquired biometric datasets in law enforcement.

### 5(1)(h) — Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification (RBI) in Public Spaces by Law Enforcement
Real-time RBI systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes. **Narrow exceptions:**
- (i) Targeted search for specific missing persons or trafficking victims
- (ii) Preventing specific, substantial, imminent threat to life or terrorist attack  
- (iii) Identifying suspects of serious criminal offenses carrying ≥4-year sentences listed in Annex II

**Procedural requirements for exceptions:** Prior judicial or independent administrative body authorization (post-hoc authorization within 24 hours for urgency); fundamental rights impact assessment; registration in EU AI database; report to market surveillance authority after each use. **Prohibited:** use to identify protected attributes.

## Art. 6 — High-Risk Classification Rules

### Path A — Art. 6(1): Safety Component of Sectoral Product
System is high-risk when BOTH conditions are met:
1. It is a **safety component of a product** covered by Annex I harmonisation legislation (or is itself such a product); **AND**
2. That product **requires third-party conformity assessment** under the relevant Annex I legislation

### Path B — Art. 6(2): Annex III Listed Use Case
System is high-risk when **listed in Annex III**, unless the following non-high-risk exceptions all apply:
- Performs a narrow procedural task
- Improves result of a previously completed human activity
- Detects decision-making patterns/deviations without replacing/influencing human assessment
- Performs preparatory tasks for assessment relevant to Annex III use cases

**Critical override (Art. 6(3)):** Any Annex III system that **profiles natural persons** is ALWAYS high-risk regardless of the above exceptions.

**Documentation obligation (Art. 6(3)):** Providers claiming non-high-risk status must document their assessment before market placement and make it available to national authorities on request.
