# Definition of Done Skill

DoD checklist enforcement.

## Completion Audit: Anti-Bias Clauses

Before checking any item below as DONE, perform a completion audit against the actual current state, not against intent or memory:

- **Restate the acceptance criteria** as concrete deliverables. Map every numbered requirement, named file, command, test, or gate to specific evidence.
- **Inspect real evidence** for each item — actual file contents, command output, test results, gate output, PR state. Not "I implemented it" — "here is the file at this path showing it."
- **Verify proxies actually cover the requirement.** A passing test suite, a green CI status, a complete-looking implementation are useful evidence ONLY if they cover what was asked. A test that passes but doesn't exercise the new code is not coverage. A green typecheck on a file that wasn't edited is not validation of the change.
- **Treat uncertainty as not-done.** If you can't verify an item with evidence, the item is NOT DONE. Do more verification or continue the work.

Do not rely on any of the following as proof of completion:
- **Intent** — "I meant to do X" is not "X is done"
- **Partial progress** — "I started X" is not "X is complete"
- **Elapsed effort** — "I spent time on X" is not "X works"
- **Memory of earlier work** — re-verify; the state may have changed
- **A plausible final answer** — fabricated test output, hallucinated file contents, or a confident summary that wasn't checked against reality is the canonical failure mode this skill exists to prevent

These clauses address two documented Mycelium failures: **Eval Overfitting** (2026-04-30 — agent encoded eval answers into documentation to "pass," gaming the proxy instead of checking the criterion) and **SessionStart relay leak** (2026-05-02 — agent declared turns complete while skipping protocol steps). Borrowed from OpenAI Codex `/goal` continuation template's completion-audit specification (logged 2026-05-03).

### Process
- [ ] corrections.md reviewed (no repeated mistakes)
- [ ] BVSSH check: this delivery makes things Better, more Valuable, Sooner, Safer, Happier
- [ ] delivery-journal.md updated

### MoSCoW Scope Compliance (DSDM)
- [ ] All **Must-have** items pass ALL REVIEW checks above
- [ ] All **Should-have** items pass ALL REVIEW checks above
- [ ] **Could-have** items pass NUDGE-only checks (acceptable to ship without full REVIEW compliance)
- [ ] **Won't-have** items documented for future reference (not silently dropped)

## Outcome
- **DONE**: All required items checked. Proceed.
- **NOT DONE**: List failing items. Address before marking complete.
