  echo ""
  echo "Create a plan with: /create-plan <feature-name>"
  exit 0

## Status Dashboard View

For a quick team dashboard, you can create an alias:

```bash
alias plans='/plan-status'

# Show all plans
plans

# Show specific plan
plans user-auth
```

## Status Meanings

| Status | Emoji | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `planning` | 📝 | Defining requirements, not started coding |
| `in_progress` | 🚧 | Active development |
| `testing` | 🧪 | Development complete, testing in progress |
| `review` | 👀 | In code review |
| `complete` | ✅ | Done and merged |
| `blocked` | 🛑 | Waiting on dependency |
| `paused` | ⏸️  | Temporarily stopped |

## Integration with Git

**Update status based on branch activity:**

```bash
# After making progress
cd worktrees/feature-name
# ... make changes ...
# Update plan status
sed -i 's/status: planning/status: in_progress/' plans/active/feature-name/plan.md
```

## Best Practices

**Daily Routine:**
1. Run `/plan-status` each morning
2. Review open questions
3. Update phase status as you progress
4. Mark tasks complete as you go

**Weekly Routine:**
1. Review all active plans
2. Archive completed plans
3. Re-prioritize if needed
4. Update estimates based on progress

**Status Updates:**
- Update `status:` field in frontmatter
- Update `phases[].status` as you complete each
- Check off `- [ ]` tasks as you finish them
- Add notes in the plan for important decisions

## Tips

**Keep Plans Updated:**
- Update immediately after completing phases
- Don't wait until end of day
- Real-time status is most useful

**Use with Stand-ups:**
- Quick overview of all active work
- Shows what's blocked
- Identifies what needs attention

**Tracking Progress:**
- Checkbox completion = task level
- Phase status = milestone level
- Overall status = project level

## Advanced: Auto-Update from Git

```bash
# Hook to update plan when pushing commits
# .git/hooks/pre-push

BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
FEATURE_NAME=$(echo $BRANCH | sed 's/feature\///')
PLAN_FILE="plans/active/$FEATURE_NAME/plan.md"

if [ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]; then
  # Auto-update to in_progress if was planning
  sed -i 's/status: planning/status: in_progress/' "$PLAN_FILE"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

**Plan not showing:**
- Check file is in `plans/active/`
- Verify `plan.md` exists
- Check YAML frontmatter is valid

**Progress not accurate:**
- Use consistent checkbox format: `- [ ]` and `- [x]`
- Don't use custom checkbox formats
- Ensure phases array in frontmatter is updated

**Worktree status wrong:**
- Verify worktree exists in `worktrees/`
- Check naming matches plan directory
- Use `/worktree-create` if missing
