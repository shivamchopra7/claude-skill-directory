# Java ADR Generator with interactive conversational approach

Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Java projects through an interactive, conversational process that systematically gathers all necessary context to produce well-structured ADR documents. **This is an interactive SKILL**.

**What is covered in this Skill?**

- ADR file storage configuration
- Conversational information gathering: context, stakeholders, decision drivers, options with pros/cons, outcome, consequences
- MADR template generation
- Validation with `./mvnw validate` or `mvn validate` before proceeding

## Constraints

Before applying any ADR generation, ensure the project validates. If validation fails, stop immediately — do not proceed until all validation errors are resolved.

- **MANDATORY**: Run `./mvnw validate` or `mvn validate` before applying any ADR generation
- **SAFETY**: If validation fails, stop immediately — do not proceed until all validation errors are resolved
- **BEFORE APPLYING**: Read the reference for detailed good/bad examples, constraints, and safeguards for each ADR generation pattern
