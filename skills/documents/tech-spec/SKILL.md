# Tech Spec Skill

## Trigger

- Keywords: tech spec, technical specification, spec review, review spec, requirement analysis, feature design

## When NOT to Use

- Creating request documents (use /create-request)
- Code implementation (use feature-dev)
- Architecture consulting (use /codex-architect)

## Commands

| Command         | Purpose              | When                    |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `/tech-spec`    | Produce tech spec    | Starting from scratch   |
| `/deep-analyze` | Deepen spec + roadmap | After initial concept   |
| `/review-spec`  | Review tech spec     | Spec confirmation       |

## Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Analyst
    participant C as Codebase
    participant D as Document

    A->>A: 1. Requirement clarification
    A->>C: 2. Code research
    C-->>A: Related modules
    A->>A: 3. Solution design
    A->>A: 4. Risk assessment
    A->>A: 5. Work breakdown
    A->>D: 6. Output document
```

## Spec Structure

1. Requirement summary (problem + goals + scope)
2. Existing code analysis
3. Technical solution (architecture + data model + API + core logic)
4. Risks and dependencies
5. Work breakdown
6. Testing strategy
7. Open questions

## Verification

- Solution covers all requirement points
- Architecture diagrams use Mermaid
- Risks have mitigation strategies
- Work can be broken into trackable items

## References

- `references/template.md` - Spec template + review dimensions
