# NLM New Topic — NotebookLM Learning Package Creator

Creates a complete NotebookLM learning package for any topic using the NLM CLI (`/Users/user/.local/bin/nlm`).

## Input Format

```
/nlm-new-topic <topic> [--url <url1> --url <url2>] [--file <path>]
```

- `<topic>` is **required**
- `--url` and `--file` are optional; if provided, these sources are added alongside auto-research

## Workflow

Execute the following 7 phases in order. Announce each phase as you enter it.

---

### Phase 1: Create Notebook

Create the notebook and capture its ID:

```bash
nlm notebook create "<topic>"
```

Capture the notebook ID from the output. This ID is used in every subsequent command.

If notebook creation fails, run `nlm doctor` and report the error to the user. Do not proceed.

---

### Phase 2: Research & Add Sources

**Step 2a — Add user-provided sources first (if any):**

For each `--url` argument:
```bash
nlm source add <notebook_id> --url <url> --wait
```

For each `--file` argument:
```bash
nlm source add <notebook_id> --file <path> --wait
```

Run these in parallel if multiple sources are provided.

**Step 2b — Auto-research:**

```bash
nlm research start "<topic>" -n <notebook_id> -m deep
```

This runs deep research (~5 minutes, ~40 sources). Then poll until complete:

```bash
nlm research status <notebook_id> --max-wait 300
```

Once complete, import all discovered sources:

```bash
nlm research import <notebook_id>
```

**Step 2c — Verify source count:**

```bash
nlm source list <notebook_id>
```

If fewer than 3 sources total, run a second fast research pass with a rephrased/broader query:

```bash
nlm research start "<broader topic query>" -n <notebook_id> -m fast
nlm research status <notebook_id> --max-wait 120
nlm research import <notebook_id>
```

If still 0 sources, ask the user to provide manual URLs.

---

### Phase 3: Summary Artifacts

Fire **all 5** summary artifact creation commands **in parallel** (do NOT wait between them):

```bash
nlm slides create <notebook_id> --focus "<topic>" -y
nlm video create <notebook_id> --focus "<topic>" -y
nlm audio create <notebook_id> --format deep_dive --focus "<topic>" -y
nlm report create <notebook_id> --format "Briefing Doc" -y
nlm mindmap create <notebook_id> --title "<topic>" -y
```

- `slides` → summary slide deck
- `video` → summary video overview
- `audio` → audio overview (podcast-style deep dive)
- `report` → briefing document
- `mindmap` → topic mind map

All commands use `-y` to skip confirmation prompts.

---

### Phase 4: Topic Decomposition

Get the AI summary of notebook content:

```bash
nlm notebook describe <notebook_id>
```

Then ask the notebook to decompose the topic into learning units:

```bash
nlm notebook query <notebook_id> "Break the topic '<topic>' into sequential learning units of roughly equal information density. Each unit MUST be mutually exclusive — no concept should appear in more than one unit. Each unit should have a short title (3-6 words), a one-sentence description of what it covers, and a one-sentence boundary note stating what it does NOT cover (i.e., what belongs to adjacent units). Order them logically: foundational concepts first, then intermediate, then advanced. Return as a numbered list with format: 'N. Title — Description. Boundary: <what this unit excludes>'. Target count: 4-7 units."
```

**Parse the response** to extract for each unit:
- **Title** (used for video naming)
- **Description** (what the unit covers)
- **Boundary** (what the unit excludes)

All three are used to build the `--focus` parameter in Phase 6.

**Adjust target count based on source richness:**
- Fewer than 5 sources → aim for 3-4 units
- 5-9 sources → aim for 4-5 units
- 10+ sources → aim for 5-7 units

---

### Phase 5: Source-to-Unit Mapping

Map notebook sources to relevant learning units so each unit's artifacts only draw from topically relevant sources.

**If the notebook has only 1 source, skip this phase entirely** — all artifacts use that single source.

**Step 5a — Collect source summaries:**

```bash
nlm source list <notebook_id> --json
```

Parse JSON to get all source IDs and titles. Then run **ALL in parallel**:

```bash
nlm source describe <source_id> --json   # for each source
```

Collect `id`, `title`, `summary` (truncate to ~100 chars), and `keywords` (first 5). If `source describe` fails for a source, use only its title in the mapping prompt.

**Step 5b — Map sources to units:**

```bash
nlm notebook query <notebook_id> "Given these learning units:
1. <title> — <description>
2. <title> — <description>
...
And these sources:
- <source_id> '<title>': <summary_snippet> [keywords: kw1, kw2]
- <source_id> '<title>': <summary_snippet> [keywords: kw1, kw2]
...
For each learning unit, list ONLY the source IDs directly relevant to that unit's specific topic. A source may appear in multiple units. Format:
Unit 1: <id>, <id>, ...
Unit 2: <id>, <id>, ..."
```

**Step 5c — Parse the mapping:**

Build map: `unit_number → [source_id1, source_id2, ...]`

**Fallback rules:**
- If a unit maps to 0 sources → use ALL sources for that unit (omit `--source-ids`)
- If the mapping query returns unparseable output → use ALL sources for all units (degrades gracefully to current behavior)

---

### Phase 6: Per-Unit Artifacts

Fire **ALL** per-unit artifact creation commands **in parallel** (maximize throughput):

For every learning unit, fire both commands simultaneously using an **enriched focus prompt** that scopes content and prevents overlap with neighboring units. Include `--source-ids` from the Phase 5 mapping to restrict each artifact to relevant sources only:

```bash
nlm infographic create <notebook_id> --focus "Unit <N> of <total>: <unit title>. <unit description>. Does NOT cover: <boundary>." --source-ids <id1>,<id2>,<id3> -y
nlm video create <notebook_id> --focus "Unit <N> of <total>: <unit title>. <unit description>. Does NOT cover: <boundary>." --source-ids <id1>,<id2>,<id3> -y
```

Build the focus string from the parsed decomposition output (title + description + boundary). Use the source IDs from the Phase 5 mapping for each unit. If a unit has no mapped sources (fallback), omit `--source-ids` entirely for that unit. For example, with 5 units this fires 10 commands in parallel.

**Error handling — retry with backoff:**

If any command fails, retry up to 3 times with increasing backoff:
1. **Retry 1:** Wait 30 seconds, then retry
2. **Retry 2:** Wait 60 seconds, then retry
3. **Retry 3:** Wait 120 seconds, then retry

If a command still fails after all retries and the error contains "Try again later":
- **Stop retrying** that artifact type (e.g., all remaining infographics)
- **Tell the user** which artifacts failed and that the cause is likely a **daily creation limit** imposed by NotebookLM on their account tier
- **List the exact commands** the user can run manually later (tomorrow) to create the missing artifacts
- Continue with any other artifact types that are still succeeding

---

### Phase 7: Verify, Order & Report

**Step 7a — Check artifact status:**

```bash
nlm studio status <notebook_id> --json
```

Poll up to 3 times with 60-second intervals until all artifacts show complete status.

**Step 7b — Rename videos in sequence order:**

Use `nlm studio rename` to create a numbered playlist:

```bash
nlm studio rename <summary_video_id> "00 - <topic> Overview"
nlm studio rename <unit1_video_id> "01 - <unit1 title>"
nlm studio rename <unit2_video_id> "02 - <unit2 title>"
```

Continue for each unit video in learning order.

**Step 7c — Present final report:**

```
## Learning Package Complete: <topic>

**Notebook URL:** https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/<notebook_id>

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Notebook creation fails** | Run `nlm doctor` and report to user |
| **0 sources found** | Try broader query; if still 0, ask user for manual URLs |
| **Artifact creation fails** | Retry up to 3 times with backoff (30s, 60s, 120s) |
| **Artifact hits daily limit** | If error contains "Try again later" after retries, stop retrying that type, inform user of likely daily limit, list commands for manual creation |
| **Artifact stuck processing** | Poll up to 3 times at 60s intervals; note incomplete items in report |
