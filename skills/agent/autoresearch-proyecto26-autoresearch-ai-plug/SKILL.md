# Autoresearch: Autonomous Experiment Loop

An autonomous optimization loop where Claude edits code, runs a benchmark, measures a metric, and keeps improvements or reverts — repeating forever until stopped.

## Core Concept

The loop is simple: **edit → commit → run → measure → keep or discard → repeat**.

- **Primary metric is king.** Lower (or higher, depending on direction) is better. Improved → keep the commit. Equal or worse → `git revert`.
- **State survives context resets** via `autoresearch.jsonl` (append-only log) and `autoresearch.md` (living session document).
- **Domain-agnostic.** Works for any measurable target: test speed, bundle size, LLM training loss, Lighthouse scores, build times, etc.
- **Be careful not to overfit to the benchmarks and do not cheat on the benchmarks.** Optimize the real workload, not the measurement harness.

## Setup Phase

When the user triggers autoresearch, gather the following (ask if not provided):

1. **Goal** — what to optimize (e.g., "reduce unit test runtime")
2. **Command** — the benchmark to run (e.g., `pnpm test`, `uv run train.py`)
3. **Primary metric** — name, unit, and direction (`lower` or `higher` is better)
4. **Secondary metrics** — optional additional metrics to track for tradeoff monitoring (e.g., memory, compile time)
5. **Files in scope** — which files can be modified
6. **Constraints** — time budget, off-limits files, correctness requirements

Optionally check for `.claude/autoresearch-ai-plugin.local.md` in the project root for persistent configuration:

```markdown
---
enabled: true
max_iterations: 50
working_dir: "/path/to/project"
benchmark_timeout: 600
checks_timeout: 300

# Autoresearch Configuration

Additional context or notes for this project's autoresearch setup.
```

- `enabled` — whether autoresearch is active (default: true)
- `max_iterations` — stop after N experiments (default: 0 = unlimited)
- `working_dir` — override directory for experiment files (default: current directory)
- `benchmark_timeout` — benchmark timeout in seconds (default: 600)
- `checks_timeout` — correctness checks timeout in seconds (default: 300)

If the file doesn't exist, use defaults. The file should be added to `.gitignore` (`.claude/*.local.md`).

Then execute these setup steps:

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b autoresearch/<goal>-<date>`
2. Ensure session files are gitignored (critical — `git revert` will fail if `autoresearch.jsonl` is tracked):
   ```bash
   echo -e "autoresearch.jsonl\nrun.log" >> .gitignore
   git add .gitignore && git commit -m "autoresearch: add session files to gitignore"
   ```
3. Read all files in scope thoroughly to understand the codebase
4. Write `autoresearch.md` — the session document (see `examples/autoresearch.md`)
5. Write `autoresearch.sh` — the benchmark script (see `examples/autoresearch.sh`)
6. Optionally write `autoresearch.checks.sh` — correctness checks (tests, lint, types)
7. Commit session files
8. Run baseline: `bash autoresearch.sh`
9. Parse metrics from output (lines matching `METRIC name=value`)
10. Record baseline in `autoresearch.jsonl` (with `"type":"config"` header first, then baseline result)
11. Begin the experiment loop

## The Experiment Loop

**LOOP FOREVER. Never ask "should I continue?" — just keep going.**

The user might be asleep, away from the computer, or expects you to work indefinitely. If each experiment takes ~5 minutes, you can run ~12/hour, ~100 overnight. The loop runs until the user interrupts you, period.

Each iteration:

```
1. Read current git state and autoresearch.md
2. Choose an experimental change (informed by past results and ASI notes)
3. Edit files in scope
4. git add <files> && git commit -m "experiment: <description>"
5. Run: bash autoresearch.sh > run.log 2>&1
6. Parse METRIC lines from output
7. If autoresearch.checks.sh exists, run it (separate timeout, default 300s)
8. Decide: keep or discard
9. Log result to autoresearch.jsonl (include ASI annotations)
10. If discard/crash: git revert $(git rev-parse HEAD) --no-edit
11. Update autoresearch.md with learnings (every few experiments)
12. Repeat
```

### Decision Rules

- **Metric improved** → `keep` (commit stays, branch advances)
- **Metric equal or worse** → `discard` (run `git revert $(git rev-parse HEAD) --no-edit`)
- **Crash or checks failed** → `discard` (revert, note the failure in ASI)
- **Simpler code for equal perf** → `keep` (removing complexity is a win)
- **Catastrophic secondary metric regression** → consider `discard` even if primary improved (e.g., 1% speed gain but 10x memory usage)
- **If stuck** → think deeper, try a different approach. Consult `autoresearch.ideas.md` if it exists. Re-read source files for new angles. Try combining previous near-misses. Try more radical changes. Read any papers or docs referenced in the code.

### Simplicity Criterion

All else being equal, simpler is better. Weigh complexity cost against improvement magnitude:

- A 0.001 improvement that adds 20 lines of hacky code? Probably not worth it.
- A 0.001 improvement from deleting code? Definitely keep.
- Equal performance with much simpler code? Keep.

### Handling User Messages During Experiments

If the user sends a message while the loop is running:
1. Finish the current experiment cycle (don't abandon mid-run)
2. Address the user's feedback or question
3. Resume the loop immediately after — do not wait for permission

### Benchmark Timeout

- Default benchmark timeout: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- If a run exceeds the timeout, kill it and treat as a crash
- Checks timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes), separate from benchmark

### Don't Thrash

If 3 consecutive experiments fail or get discarded:
1. Stop and think about why
2. Re-read the source files for new angles
3. Try a fundamentally different approach
4. Consult `autoresearch.ideas.md` for untried ideas

## Metric Output Format

Benchmark scripts output metrics as structured lines:

```
METRIC total_time=4.23
METRIC memory_mb=512
METRIC val_bpb=1.042
```

Parse these with the helper script at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/parse-metrics.sh`:

```bash
bash autoresearch.sh 2>&1 | bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/parse-metrics.sh
```

### Secondary Metrics

Beyond the primary metric, output additional `METRIC` lines for tradeoff monitoring:

```
METRIC total_ms=4230        # primary
METRIC compile_ms=1200      # secondary — helps identify bottlenecks
METRIC memory_mb=512        # secondary — monitors resource usage
METRIC cache_hit_rate=0.85  # secondary — instrumentation data
```

Secondary metrics are tracked in the JSONL log and help guide future experiments, but they rarely affect keep/discard decisions (only discard if a catastrophic secondary regression accompanies a marginal primary improvement).

**Output instrumentation data** — phase timings, error counts, cache rates, domain-specific signals. This data guides the next iteration and helps identify where optimization effort should focus.

## Actionable Side Information (ASI)

ASI is structured annotation per experiment that **survives reverts**. When code changes are discarded, only the description and ASI remain — making them the only structured memory of what happened.

Record ASI for every experiment:

```json
{
  "hypothesis": "Reducing loop iterations by breaking early",
  "result": "Marginal speedup but code readability suffered",
  "next_action_hint": "Try vectorization instead of loop unrolling",
  "bottleneck": "Memory bandwidth on L2 cache misses"
}
```

ASI fields are free-form — use whatever keys are useful:
- `hypothesis` — what you expected
- `result` — what actually happened
- `next_action_hint` — guidance for the next experiment
- `bottleneck` — identified performance bottleneck
- `error_details` — crash/failure diagnostics
- Any other domain-specific observations

## Logging to autoresearch.jsonl

### Config Header (written once at setup)

```json
{"type":"config","name":"Optimize unit test runtime","metricName":"total_ms","metricUnit":"ms","bestDirection":"lower"}
```

### Experiment Results (appended after each run)

Each experiment appends one JSON line:

```json
{"run":5,"commit":"abc1234","metric":4230,"metrics":{"compile_ms":1200,"memory_mb":512},"status":"keep","description":"parallelized test suites","timestamp":1700000000,"segment":0,"confidence":2.3,"asi":{"hypothesis":"parallel tests reduce wall time","next_action_hint":"try worker pool size tuning"}}
```

Fields:
- `run` — experiment number (1-indexed, sequential)
- `commit` — short git commit hash (7 chars)
- `metric` — primary metric value
- `metrics` — secondary metrics dict (optional)
- `status` — one of: `keep`, `discard`, `crash`, `checks_failed`
- `description` — brief description of what was tried
- `timestamp` — Unix timestamp (seconds)
- `segment` — session segment index (0-based, incremented when optimization target changes)
- `confidence` — MAD-based confidence score (null if < 3 experiments)
- `asi` — Actionable Side Information dict (optional, omit if empty)

Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/log-experiment.sh` to append entries:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/log-experiment.sh \
  --run 5 \
  --commit "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
  --metric 4230 \
  --status keep \
  --description "parallelized test suites" \
  --metrics '{"compile_ms":1200,"memory_mb":512}' \
  --segment 0 \
  --confidence 2.3 \
  --asi '{"hypothesis":"parallel tests reduce wall time"}'
```

Valid statuses: `keep`, `discard`, `crash`, `checks_failed`

## Segments (Multi-Phase Sessions)

When the optimization target changes mid-session (different benchmark, metric, or workload):

1. Write a new config header to `autoresearch.jsonl` with the updated target
2. Increment the segment counter
3. Old results stay in the JSONL but are filtered as previous phase
4. Establish a new baseline for the new segment

This allows a single session to evolve — e.g., first optimize compilation speed, then switch to runtime performance.

## Resuming After Context Reset

If `autoresearch.jsonl` and `autoresearch.md` exist in the working directory:

1. Read `autoresearch.md` for full context (goal, metrics, files, constraints, learnings)
2. Read `autoresearch.jsonl` to see all past experiments, current best, and ASI annotations
3. Check `autoresearch.ideas.md` if it exists — prune stale entries, experiment with remaining ideas
4. Check git log to verify current branch state matches expected state
5. Resume the loop from where it left off — no re-setup needed
6. **Resume immediately** — do not ask "should I continue?"

## Confidence Scoring

After 3+ experiments, assess whether improvements are real or noise:

- Compute the **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)** of all metric values in the current segment as a noise floor
- **Confidence = |best improvement| / MAD**
- ≥2.0× → likely real improvement (green)
- 1.0–2.0× → marginal, could be noise (yellow)
- <1.0× → within noise floor (red) — consider re-running to confirm

Record confidence on each experiment result in the JSONL log. When confidence is low, consider:
- Running the benchmark multiple times inside `autoresearch.sh` and reporting the median
- Pinning CPU frequency or reducing system noise
- Making larger changes that produce clearer signal

See `references/confidence-scoring.md` for detailed methodology.

## Session Files

| File | Purpose | Created by |
|------|---------|------------|
| `autoresearch.md` | Living session document — goal, metrics, scope, learnings | Setup phase |
| `autoresearch.sh` | Benchmark script — outputs `METRIC name=value` lines | Setup phase |
| `autoresearch.checks.sh` | Optional correctness checks (tests, lint, types) | Setup phase |
| `autoresearch.jsonl` | Append-only experiment log (survives restarts) | First experiment |
| `autoresearch.ideas.md` | Optional backlog of ideas to try | Anytime |
| `.claude/autoresearch-ai-plugin.local.md` | Optional persistent configuration (max_iterations, working_dir, timeouts) | User-provided |

## Cancel and Status

### Cancelling an Autoresearch Session

When the user asks to cancel or stop autoresearch:

1. Finish the current experiment cycle if one is running
2. Read `autoresearch.jsonl` to count total experiments and results
3. Report a summary: goal, total runs, kept improvements, best metric
4. Remove `.claude/autoresearch-ai-plugin.local.md` if it exists
5. Do NOT delete `autoresearch.jsonl` or `autoresearch.md` — they contain valuable history
6. Do NOT revert any kept commits — the improvements are real
7. Inform the user they can resume later with `/autoresearch`

### Checking Session Status

When the user asks about autoresearch status or progress:

1. Check if `autoresearch.jsonl` exists — if not, report "No active session"
2. Read `autoresearch.md` for the goal and primary metric
3. Parse `autoresearch.jsonl` to compute: total runs, kept/discarded/crashed counts, baseline vs best, improvement percentage, confidence score
4. Display a formatted summary
