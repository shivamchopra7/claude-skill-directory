# Testing Quality Standards

Shared quality standards and metrics for testing across all plugins in the Claude Night Market ecosystem.

## Coverage Thresholds

| Level | Coverage | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Minimum | 60% | Legacy code |
| Standard | 80% | Normal development |
| High | 90% | Critical systems |
| detailed | 95%+ | Safety-critical |

## Quality Metrics

### Structure
- [ ] Clear test organization
- [ ] Meaningful test names
- [ ] Proper setup/teardown
- [ ] Isolated test cases

### Coverage
- [ ] Critical paths covered
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Error conditions handled
- [ ] Integration points verified

### Maintainability
- [ ] DRY test code
- [ ] Reusable fixtures
- [ ] Clear assertions
- [ ] Minimal mocking

### Reliability
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Deterministic execution
- [ ] No order dependencies
- [ ] Fast feedback loop

## Detailed Topics

For implementation patterns and examples:

- **[Anti-Patterns](modules/anti-patterns.md)** - Common testing mistakes with before/after examples
- **[Best Practices](modules/best-practices.md)** - Core testing principles and exit criteria

## Integration with Plugin Testing

This skill provides foundational standards referenced by:
- `pensive:test-review` - Uses coverage thresholds and quality metrics
- `parseltongue:python-testing` - Uses anti-patterns and best practices
- `sanctum:test-*` - Uses quality checklist for test validation

Reference in your skill's frontmatter:
```yaml
dependencies: [leyline:testing-quality-standards]
```
**Verification:** Run `pytest -v` to verify tests pass.
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests not discovered**
Ensure test files match pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`. Run `pytest --collect-only` to verify.

**Import errors**
Check that the module being tested is in `PYTHONPATH` or install with `pip install -e .`

**Async tests failing**
Install pytest-asyncio and decorate test functions with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
