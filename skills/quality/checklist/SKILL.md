# Quality Validation Checklist Generator

Generate domain-specific quality checklists to validate implementation completeness.

---

## SpecKit Workflow

This skill runs **after tasks, before analyze**:

specify → plan → tasks → **checklist** → analyze → implement

Purpose:
- Generate validation checklist from spec/plan/tasks
- **Ensure quality gates are defined**
- **Ensure TDD requirements are included**
- **Ensure routing compliance is checked**
- Provide implement phase with verification criteria

---

## TDD is MANDATORY

Every generated checklist MUST include these testing items:

### Testing & TDD (Required for ALL stories)
- [ ] Unit tests written BEFORE implementation
- [ ] Unit tests verified to FAIL before coding
- [ ] Integration tests for API/data flows
- [ ] E2E tests for user-facing flows
- [ ] Test coverage meets 80% target
- [ ] All tests pass

**These items are non-negotiable and must appear in every checklist.**

---

## Mandatory Quality Gates

Every story in the checklist MUST include:

### Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)
- [ ] `bun run typecheck` passes with 0 errors
- [ ] `bun run lint` passes with 0 errors AND 0 warnings
- [ ] `bun test` passes
- [ ] No debug code (console.log, debugger)
- [ ] No unused imports or variables

**All three commands must pass - no exceptions.**

---

## Routing Validation Items

Every checklist MUST include:

### Routing Compliance
- [ ] Routing preference documented in spec.md
- [ ] prd.json has routing metadata for all stories
- [ ] Complexity classifications match story scope
- [ ] Estimated costs are reasonable
- [ ] Mode selection (free/cheap/good/genius) is appropriate

---

## The Job

1. Read spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md
2. Extract quality requirements from constitution
3. **Include mandatory TDD items**
4. **Include mandatory quality gate items**
5. **Include routing compliance items**
6. Generate comprehensive checklist
7. Save to `checklist.md`

**Important:** Checklist items get merged into prd.json acceptance criteria!

---

## Step 1: Locate Feature Files

Verify these files exist:
- `relentless/features/NNN-feature/spec.md`
- `relentless/features/NNN-feature/plan.md`
- `relentless/features/NNN-feature/tasks.md`

---

## Step 2: Load Context

Read:
1. `relentless/constitution.md` - Quality standards and requirements
2. Feature files (spec, plan, tasks)
3. Identify the feature domain (auth, payments, dashboard, etc.)

---

## Step 3: Generate Checklist Categories

Create 7-10 categories based on feature domain:

**Mandatory Categories (always include):**
- **0. Quality Gates** - typecheck, lint, test
- **1. TDD Compliance** - tests before code
- **2. Routing Compliance** - metadata validation

**Common Categories (include as needed):**
- Schema & Database
- Backend Logic
- Frontend Components (if applicable)
- API Integration
- Security & Permissions
- Performance & UX
- Documentation

If you have any doubts or suggestions about the checklist, please, interview the user.
---

## Step 4: Generate Checklist Items

For each category, create 5-10 specific validation items:

**Format:**
```markdown
- [ ] CHK-001 [US-001] Specific, testable requirement
- [ ] CHK-002 [Gap] Missing specification identified
- [ ] CHK-003 [Ambiguity] Unclear requirement needs clarification
- [ ] CHK-004 [Edge Case] Potential edge case to handle
```

**Guidelines:**
- 80% of items should reference specific user stories `[US-XXX]`
- 20% should identify gaps, ambiguities, or edge cases
- Each item must be specific and testable
- Total: 30-50 items across all categories

---

## Step 5: Reference Constitution

Ensure checklist includes items for constitution MUST rules:
- Type safety requirements (no `any` types)
- Testing coverage (80% minimum)
- Security standards
- Performance expectations
- Code quality standards (0 lint warnings)

---

## Step 6: Save & Validate

1. Save to `relentless/features/NNN-feature/checklist.md`
2. **Run the validator to ensure checklist.md is correctly formatted:**
   ```bash
   .claude/skills/validators/scripts/validate-checklist.sh "relentless/features/NNN-feature/checklist.md"
   ```
   - If validation fails, fix the errors and re-run
   - Warnings are acceptable but should be reviewed
3. Report:
   - Total checklist items: N
   - Items per category
   - Mandatory items included: TDD ✓, Quality Gates ✓, Routing ✓
   - Constitution compliance items: N
   - Gaps identified: N
   - Validation: PASS/FAIL
   - Next step: `/relentless.convert` (if not done) or `/relentless.analyze`

## Example Checklist

```markdown
# Quality Checklist: User Authentication

**Purpose:** Validate completeness of user authentication implementation
**Created:** 2026-01-11
**Feature:** [spec.md](./spec.md)

## 0. Quality Gates (MANDATORY - Every Story)

- [ ] CHK-001 `bun run typecheck` passes with 0 errors
- [ ] CHK-002 `bun run lint` passes with 0 errors AND 0 warnings
- [ ] CHK-003 `bun test` passes
- [ ] CHK-004 No debug code (console.log, debugger statements)
- [ ] CHK-005 No unused imports or variables

## 1. TDD Compliance (MANDATORY)

## Notes

- Checklist items will be merged into acceptance criteria during convert
- Reference user stories with `[US-XXX]` tags
- Identify gaps and ambiguities with `[Gap]` and `[Ambiguity]` tags
- Each item must be independently verifiable
- Balance between comprehensiveness and practicality
- **Mandatory sections (Quality Gates, TDD, Routing) must always be included**
