# risk-cycle

Continuous risk identification, assessment, tracking, and retirement throughout SDLC.

## Triggers

- "risk review"
- "update risks"
- "new risk"
- "risk status"
- "mitigate risk"
- "retire risk"
- "risk cycle"

## Purpose

This skill manages continuous risk management by:
- Identifying new risks from project activities
- Assessing risk severity and probability
- Tracking mitigation progress
- Escalating overdue or critical risks
- Retiring completed risk mitigations
- Generating risk reports for stakeholders

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill:

1. **Reviews current state**:
   - Load risk register
   - Check mitigation status
   - Identify overdue items

2. **Identifies new risks**:
   - Analyze recent changes
   - Review technical decisions
   - Check external factors
   - Gather team input

3. **Assesses risks**:
   - Score probability and impact
   - Calculate risk score
   - Prioritize by exposure

4. **Plans mitigations**:
   - Assign owners
   - Define mitigation actions
   - Set target dates

5. **Tracks progress**:
   - Update mitigation status
   - Escalate overdue items
   - Retire completed risks

6. **Reports status**:
   - Generate risk dashboard
   - Highlight top risks
   - Show trend over time
