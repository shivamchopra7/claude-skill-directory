# /spec-verify - Verification Phase

**Phase 3 of the /spec workflow (features).** Runs comprehensive verification: automated checks, code review, program execution, and E2E tests. For bugfix plans, use `spec-bugfix-verify` instead.

**Input:** Plan file with `Status: COMPLETE`
**Output:** Plan status → VERIFIED (success) or loop back to implementation (failure)

---

## ⛔ KEY CONSTRAINTS

1. **Run code review when enabled** — Step 3.1 launches `changes-review` via `Task(subagent_type="pilot:changes-review")` when `PILOT_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` is not `"false"` (read in Step 0). To disable, use Console Settings → Reviewers → Changes Review toggle.
2. **Only changes-review — NEVER spec-review** — Do NOT launch `spec-review` during verification. Do NOT read or reference `findings-spec-review-*.json` files — they are stale artifacts from the planning phase that were already addressed during implementation. If you encounter a spec-review findings file, **ignore it completely**.
3. **NO stopping** — Everything automatic. Never ask "Should I fix these?"
4. **Fix ALL findings** — must_fix AND should_fix. No permission needed.
5. **Code changes finish BEFORE runtime testing** — Phase A then Phase B.
6. **Plan file is source of truth** — re-read it after auto-compaction, don't rely on conversation memory.
7. **Re-verification after fixes is MANDATORY** — fixes can introduce new bugs.
8. **Quality over speed** — never rush due to context pressure.

---

## Step 0: Read Toggle Configuration

**⛔ Run FIRST, before any other step.** Read the reviewer toggle env vars:

```bash
echo "REVIEWER=$PILOT_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED CODEX_CHG=$PILOT_CODEX_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED"
```

Codex reviewers are controlled entirely by Console Settings — the env vars are authoritative.

Reference these values in Steps 3.1, 3.4, and 3.5.

---

## The Process

```
Phase A — Finalize the code:
  Launch Reviewer → Automated Checks (tests + lint + verify commands) → Feature Parity (if migration) → Collect Review Results → Fix

Phase B — Verify the running program (depth depends on runtime profile):
  Build → Program Execution → Per-Task DoD Audit → E2E

Final:
  Regression check → Worktree sync → Post-merge verification → Update status
```

---

## Step 3.0: Classify Runtime Profile

**Determine verification depth based on what changed:**

| Profile | Criteria | Phase B Scope |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Minimal** | No server, no UI, no built artifacts (libraries, CLI tools, hooks, scripts) | Build check only |
| **API** | Server/API but no frontend changes | Build + program execution + DoD audit. Skip E2E. |
| **Full** | Frontend/UI changes or complex deployment | All Phase B steps |

Read the plan's Runtime Environment section (if present) and the changed file types to classify.

---

## Phase A: Finalize the Code

### Step 3.0b: Clean Up Stale Spec-Review Findings

**⛔ ALWAYS run this step** — regardless of whether changes-review is enabled. Spec-review findings are stale artifacts from the planning phase that were already addressed during implementation.

```bash
rm -f ~/.pilot/sessions/$PILOT_SESSION_ID/findings-spec-review-*.json
```

### Step 3.1: Launch Code Review Agent (Early)

**⛔ If `PILOT_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` is `"false"` (from Step 0),** skip this step entirely and proceed to Step 3.2. (Automated checks in Step 3.2 still run; only the agent-based review is skipped.)

**When enabled:** Launch the reviewer IMMEDIATELY — it works in the background while you run automated checks.

#### 3.1a: Gather Context

```bash
git status --short  # Changed files
echo $PILOT_SESSION_ID
```

**Validate session ID:** If `$PILOT_SESSION_ID` is empty, fall back to `"default"` to avoid writing to `~/.pilot/sessions//`.

Collect: changed files list, test framework constraints, runtime environment info, plan risks section.

**Derive plan slug** from the plan filename: strip the date prefix (`YYYY-MM-DD-`) and `.md` extension. Example: `2026-03-02-sku-builder-modal-cleanup.md` → `sku-builder-modal-cleanup`.

Output path: `~/.pilot/sessions/<session-id>/findings-changes-review-<plan-slug>.json`

#### 3.1b: Launch

**⛔ Delete stale changes-review findings before launching** (previous run may have left a file):

```bash
rm -f ~/.pilot/sessions/$PILOT_SESSION_ID/findings-changes-review-*.json
```

```
Task(
  subagent_type="pilot:changes-review",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="""
  **Plan file:** <plan-path>
  **User request:** <original task description that invoked /spec>
  **Changed files:** [file list]
  **Output path:** <absolute path to findings JSON>
  **Runtime environment:** [how to start, port, deploy path]
  **Test framework constraints:** [what it can/cannot test]

  Review implementation: compliance (plan match + user request match), quality (security, bugs, tests, performance), goal (achievement, artifacts, wiring).
  Performance: check for expensive uncached work on hot paths, heavy dependency imports with lighter alternatives, and repeated invocations that redo work when input hasn't changed.
  Write findings JSON to output_path using Write tool.
  IMPORTANT: Include the plan file path in your output JSON as the "plan_file" field.
  """
)
```

**Do NOT wait.** Proceed to Codex launch (if enabled) or Step 3.2 immediately.

#### Codex Adversarial Review (Optional — launch immediately after Claude reviewer)

**If `PILOT_CODEX_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` is `"true"` (from Step 0):**

Launch Codex review NOW — it runs in parallel with the Claude reviewer above.

1. Detect companion path and ensure project root:
```bash
CODEX_COMPANION=$(ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/openai-codex/codex/*/scripts/codex-companion.mjs 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)
PROJECT_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT:-$(pwd)}"
```

2. Launch adversarial review in background using `--scope working-tree` (reviews all uncommitted changes regardless of staging state — works in both worktree and non-worktree mode). **⛔ Use `Bash(run_in_background=true)`** — the companion's `--background` flag is a no-op for reviews (only works for `task`), so we use Claude Code's background bash instead:
```bash
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" && node "$CODEX_COMPANION" adversarial-review --scope working-tree "Challenge this implementation: <plan summary/goal>. Plan: <plan-path>. Focus on: wrong approach, missing edge cases, security gaps, untested paths, and design choices that could fail under load."
```
**Do NOT wait** — proceed to Step 3.2 immediately. You'll be notified when the background bash completes.

### Step 3.2: Automated Checks

Run all mechanical checks in sequence. Fix any failures before proceeding.

1. **Full test suite** — `uv run pytest -q` / `bun test` / `npm test`. Fix failures immediately.
2. **Type checker** — `basedpyright` / `tsc --noEmit`. Zero errors required.
3. **Linter** — `ruff check` / `eslint`. Errors are blockers, warnings acceptable.
4. **Coverage** — Verify ≥ 80%.
5. **Build** — Clean build, zero errors.
6. **File length** — Changed production files (non-test): >800 lines consider splitting, >1000 flag for review.
7. **Plan verify commands** — For each task's `Verify:` section, run each command wrapped in `timeout 30 <cmd> || echo 'TIMEOUT'`. Defer server-dependent commands (containing `curl`, `localhost`, `http://`, browser automation) to Phase B.
8. **Performance audit** — For each changed file on a hot path (UI render, request handler, polling loop, CLI inner loop): is expensive work (parsing, serialization, I/O, dependency loading) cached/memoized? Are heavy dependencies imported fully when lighter alternatives exist? Does repeated invocation redo work when input hasn't changed? **This is a static code review — no running program needed.** Performance issues from missing caching are structural and visible in the source.

### Step 3.3: Feature Parity Check (migration/refactoring only)

Skip unless the plan has a Feature Inventory section.

1. Compare old vs new implementation
2. Verify each feature exists in new code
3. Run new code and verify same behavior

**If features are MISSING:** Add tasks with `[MISSING]` prefix, set `Status: PENDING`, increment `Iterations`, register status change, invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`.

### Step 3.4: Collect Review Results

**⛔ If `PILOT_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` is `"false"` (from Step 0 — Step 3.1 was skipped),** skip this step entirely and proceed to Step 3.6 (Phase B). There are no findings to collect.

**When enabled — mandatory. Never skip** — even if you're confident, context is high, or tests pass.

**⛔ NEVER use `TaskOutput`** to retrieve results — it dumps the full agent transcript into context, wasting thousands of tokens.

**Wait for Claude reviewer results (bash polling — NOT Read loop):**

```bash
OUTPUT_PATH="<findings-path>"
for i in $(seq 1 250); do [ -f "$OUTPUT_PATH" ] && echo "READY" && break; sleep 2; done
```

Then Read the file once. If not READY after ~8 min, re-launch synchronously.

**⛔ Validate findings:** After reading the JSON, verify that the `plan_file` field matches the current plan path. If it doesn't match, the findings are stale from a previous `/spec` — delete the file, re-launch the reviewer, and wait again.

#### Fix Claude Reviewer Findings

**Fix automatically — no user permission needed.**

1. **must_fix** → Fix immediately (security, crashes, TDD violations)
2. **should_fix** → Fix immediately (spec deviations, missing tests, error handling)
3. **suggestions** → Implement if quick

For each fix: implement → run relevant tests → log "Fixed: [title]"

#### Collect Codex Results (if launched)

**⛔ MANDATORY — NEVER skip or defer the Codex review.** If Codex was launched in Step 3.1, you MUST collect and act on its results before proceeding past Step 3.4. The Codex review runs as a `Bash(run_in_background=true)` — you will be automatically notified when it completes.

**⛔ The completion notification is the ONLY valid signal.** Do NOT read the output file to check if the review is done. The file may contain partial output from an in-progress review — reading it before the notification arrives leads to false conclusions ("no findings" when the review is still running). This is the #1 cause of premature Codex skip.

**⛔ If the notification hasn't arrived yet:** STOP. Do NOT proceed to Phase B, do NOT say "still running, moving on", do NOT read the output file, do NOT conclude the review failed. Wait for the `<task-notification>` with `<status>completed</status>`. If you are tempted to check the file — that is the exact mistake this rule prevents.

1. **When (and ONLY when) the completion notification arrives**, read the background bash output. The companion prints the full review to stdout. **Filter out `[codex]` prefixed log lines** — the actual review content is the non-prefixed lines. Use `ctx_execute_file` to extract only non-`[codex]` lines. Search for `# Codex Adversarial Review` section via `ctx_search`.

2. **Parse the output:** Extract `Verdict:` and `Findings:` lines. Map severities: `[high]` / `[critical]` → must_fix, `[medium]` / `[low]` → should_fix. Fix all must_fix/should_fix.

3. **If the background bash timed out or failed** (exit code non-zero in the notification): Re-launch synchronously (not in background) and wait for results. Only skip if the second attempt also fails.

**Report:**
```
## Code Verification Complete
**Issues Found:** X
### Goal Achievement: N/M truths verified
### Must Fix (N) | Should Fix (N) | Suggestions (N)
```

### Step 3.5: Re-verification (Only for Structural Fixes)

**⛔ If `PILOT_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` is `"false"` (from Step 0 — Steps 3.1/3.4 were skipped),** skip this step entirely and proceed to Phase B.

**When enabled:** **Skip** when fixes were localized (terminology, error handling, test updates, minor bugs). Run tests + lint to confirm, proceed to Phase B.

**Re-verify** when fixes required new functionality, changed APIs, or significant new code paths: re-launch changes-review, fix new findings. Max 2 iterations before adding remaining issues to plan.

---

## Phase B: Verify the Running Program

All code is finalized. No more code changes except critical bugs found during execution.

**If runtime profile is Minimal:** Run build check (Step 3.6a), then skip to Final section.

### Step 3.6: Build, Deploy, and Verify Code Identity

#### 3.6a: Build

Build/compile the project. Verify zero errors.

#### 3.6b: Deploy (if applicable)

If project builds artifacts deployed separately from source: copy to install location, restart services. Check `ps aux | grep <service>` before restarting shared services.

#### 3.6c: Code Identity Verification

**⛔ Prove the running instance uses your new code before testing it.**

1. Identify a behavioral change unique to this implementation
2. Craft a request only new code handles correctly (e.g., query with new parameter — new code returns filtered results, old code ignores parameter)
3. If response matches OLD behavior → redeploy, restart, re-verify
4. **Do NOT proceed** to execution testing until code identity is confirmed

### Step 3.7: Program Execution Verification

**If runtime profile is Minimal:** Skip.

**⚠️ Parallel spec warning:** Before starting a server, check port availability: `lsof -i :<port>`. If another `/spec` session occupies it, wait or use a different port.

- Program starts without errors
- Inspect logs for errors/warnings/stack traces
- **Verify output correctness** — fetch source data independently, compare against program output. If mismatch → BUG.
- Test with real/sample data
- **Performance check (UI changes):** Open the page, monitor for lag or high CPU. Watch for: components rendering expensive operations without `useMemo`/`useCallback`, eager loading of all data on mount (lazy-load instead), missing virtualization for large lists, network request storms (N+1 fetches). If page feels sluggish → profile and fix before proceeding.

**Bugs:** Minor → fix, re-run, continue. Major → add task to plan, set PENDING, loop back to implementation.

### Step 3.8: Per-Task DoD Audit

**If runtime profile is Minimal:** Skip.

For EACH task, verify its Definition of Done criteria against the running program with evidence (command output, API response, screenshot).

If any criterion unmet: fix inline if possible, or add task and loop back.

### Step 3.8b: Not Verified Acknowledgment

List what was **NOT** verified and why. Include in the verification report (Step 3.13). Every gap must have a reason:

| Not Verified | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| [criterion or scenario] | No test environment / Out of scope / Untestable statically / Deferred |

"None — all criteria have automated verification" is a valid answer if true. Do not omit this section: absence of acknowledged gaps ≠ absence of real gaps.

### Step 3.9: E2E Verification (Full profile only)

**If runtime profile is not Full:** Skip.

#### 3.9a: Resolve Browser Tool

**4-tier priority** (see `browser-automation.md`): Chrome → Chrome DevTools MCP → playwright-cli → agent-browser.

1. **Claude Code Chrome:** Check if `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools are in your available/deferred tools list. If available, use Chrome for all E2E steps below. Load tools via `ToolSearch(query="select:mcp__claude-in-chrome__<tool>")`. No session isolation needed.

2. **Chrome DevTools MCP:** If Chrome extension is unavailable, check for `mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp_chrome-devtools__*` tools. Load via `ToolSearch(query="chrome-devtools-mcp", max_results=30)`. Use `take_snapshot()` for a11y tree with uids, `click(uid=...)` / `fill(uid=...)` for interaction.

3. **playwright-cli (CLI fallback):** If neither Chrome tool is available, use playwright-cli for thorough E2E.
```bash
playwright-cli -s=$PILOT_SESSION_ID open <url>
```

4. **agent-browser (lightweight fallback):** If none of the above are available:
```bash
AB_SESSION="${PILOT_SESSION_ID:-default}"
agent-browser --session "$AB_SESSION" open <url>
```

#### 3.9b: Check for Structured Scenarios

Read the plan's `## E2E Test Scenarios` section (if it exists).

**If structured scenarios exist (TS-NNN format):** Follow 3.9c below.

**If no structured scenarios:** Fall back to ad-hoc verification — test the primary user workflow (every view, interaction, state transition), then cover edge cases:

| Category | What to test |
|----------|-------------|
| Empty state | No data, no results |
| Invalid input | Bad params, wrong types, injection |
| Stale state | References to deleted data |
| Error state | Backend unreachable |
| Boundary | Max values, zero, single item |

Then skip to 3.9e (close browser + write results).

#### 3.9c: Execute Structured Scenarios

Create one task per scenario for tracking. Execute Critical first, then High, then Medium.

```
TaskCreate(subject="TS-NNN: [name]", description="[priority] | [preconditions]")
```

**For each scenario:**

1. `TaskUpdate → in_progress`
2. Execute each step using the resolved browser tool:
   - **Chrome:** `navigate` to open pages, `read_page` after interactions, `computer`/`form_input` per the step's action
   - **Chrome DevTools MCP:** `navigate_page` to open pages, `take_snapshot` after interactions, `click(uid=...)`/`fill(uid=...)` per the step's action
   - **playwright-cli:** `open`/`goto` to navigate, `snapshot` after interactions, `click`/`fill`/`press` per the step's action (refs are bare: `e1` not `@e1`)
   - **agent-browser:** `open`/`goto` to navigate, `snapshot -i` after interactions, `click`/`fill`/`press` per the step's action (refs use `@`: `@e1`)
   - Verify the expected result by reading the page output
3. **PASS:** All steps match expected results → `TaskUpdate → completed`, note `TS-NNN: PASS`
4. **FAIL:** Step result doesn't match expected:
   - Analyze root cause, implement minimal fix, re-run relevant tests (stay in Phase B — no code changes that need re-review)
   - Re-execute the scenario (counts as fix attempt 1)
   - If still failing: implement second fix, re-execute (fix attempt 2)
   - After 2 failed fix attempts: `TaskUpdate → completed`, note `TS-NNN: KNOWN_ISSUE — [description]`
5. **Critical KNOWN_ISSUE** → set `Status: PENDING`, increment `Iterations`, register status change, invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')` — do not proceed to VERIFIED
6. **High/Medium KNOWN_ISSUE** → document and continue (non-blocking)

#### 3.9d: Write E2E Results to Plan

After all scenarios are executed, append to the plan file:

```markdown
## E2E Results

| Scenario | Priority | Result | Fix Attempts | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| TS-001   | Critical | PASS   | 0            |       |
| TS-002   | High     | PASS   | 1            | Fixed: missing validation on empty submit |
| TS-003   | Medium   | KNOWN_ISSUE | 2       | Tooltip misaligned on narrow viewport |
```

#### 3.9e: Close Browser

```bash
# Chrome / Chrome DevTools MCP: no explicit close needed
# playwright-cli: playwright-cli -s=$PILOT_SESSION_ID close
# agent-browser: agent-browser --session "$AB_SESSION" close
```

---

## Final

### Step 3.10: Final Regression Check

Re-run full test suite + type checker + build one final time. If code changed during Phase B this catches regressions. If no code changed, it confirms Phase A's green state — cheap insurance.

### Step 3.11: Worktree Sync (if worktree active)

1. Extract plan slug from path (strip date prefix and `.md`)

2. Check: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree detect --json <plan_slug>`

3. **If no worktree:** Skip to Step 3.13.

4. **Save plan to project root** (only if gitignored):
   ```bash
   git -C <project_root> check-ignore -q docs/plans/<plan_filename>
   ```
   If exit 0 (ignored): `cp <worktree_plan_path> <project_root>/docs/plans/<plan_filename>`
   If exit 1 (tracked): skip — the squash merge will bring the updated plan.

5. **Show diff:** `~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree diff --json <plan_slug>`

6. **Notify and ask:**
   ```bash
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot notify plan_approval "Worktree Sync" "<plan_name> — approve merge" --plan-path "<plan_path>" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   AskUserQuestion: "Yes, squash merge" (Recommended) | "No, keep worktree" | "Discard all changes"

7. **Handle choice:**

   **Squash merge:**
   ```bash
   # ⛔ ALL THREE operations MUST be in ONE Bash call chained with &&
   # If sync fails, cleanup MUST NOT run — otherwise work is lost.
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree sync --json <plan_slug> && PROJECT_ROOT=$(~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree cleanup --force --json <plan_slug> | jq -r '.project_root') && cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"
   ```
   ⛔ NEVER split sync, cleanup, or cd into separate Bash calls — compaction between them can cause work loss.
   ⛔ The `&&` chain ensures cleanup only runs after a successful sync.

   **Keep worktree:** Report path, user can sync later.
   **Discard:** `cleanup --discard` + `cd` in same bash call (no sync needed — `--discard` explicitly allows deleting unmerged work).

### Step 3.12: Post-Merge Verification (after squash merge only)

**Mandatory after successful worktree sync.** The squash merge can introduce breakage from base branch divergence.

1. Run full test suite
2. Run type checker / linter
3. Build verification
4. Program launch smoke test

If any fails: fix on base branch, re-run, commit fix separately (e.g., `fix: resolve post-merge regression from spec/<slug>`).

**⛔ Do NOT proceed to Step 3.13 until all post-merge checks pass.**

### Step 3.12b: Check for Code Review Feedback

**Run BEFORE marking VERIFIED.** Check if the user has left code review annotations in the Console's Changes tab. Annotations auto-save to the unified JSON — no "Send Feedback" button needed.

Derive the annotation file path: `docs/plans/.annotations/<plan-filename>.json` (same basename as the plan, `.json` extension).

Read the annotation file with the Read tool. If the file doesn't exist, treat as `NO_FEEDBACK`. If it exists, check whether `codeReviewAnnotations` has any entries (`FEEDBACK_EXISTS`) or is empty/missing (`NO_FEEDBACK`).

**If `FEEDBACK_EXISTS`:**
1. Each annotation in `codeReviewAnnotations` has `filePath`, `lineStart`, `lineEnd`, `side`, and `text` (user's annotation)
2. Fix all issues raised (each annotation = a required fix at the indicated file/line)
3. Delete the annotation file: `rm -f "<annotation-file-path>"` (e.g. `rm -f "docs/plans/.annotations/2026-03-26-my-feature.json"`). By this phase, plan annotations were already consumed by `spec-plan`, so deleting the whole file is safe. Direct deletion avoids curl which is blocked in several hook environments.
4. Re-run tests and typecheck
5. Continue to Step 3.13

**If `NO_FEEDBACK`:** continue to Step 3.13.

### Step 3.13: Code Review Gate (User Confirmation)

**⛔ MANDATORY before marking VERIFIED.** All automated checks pass — but the user should review the actual code changes.

**⛔ MUST use `AskUserQuestion`** — the stop guard only allows stopping when it detects this tool in the transcript. Plain text output will cause the stop guard to block session exit while waiting for user feedback.

1. Notify:
   ```bash
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot notify plan_approval "Verification Complete — Review Changes" "<plan_name> — please review code in Changes tab" --plan-path "<plan_path>" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

2. Summarize what was done (brief: changes made, tests passed, issues fixed), then ask:

   ```
   AskUserQuestion(
     question="All automated checks passed. Please review the code changes in the Console's **Changes** tab.\n\nYou can leave inline annotations on specific lines using the **Review** mode toggle — annotations save automatically.\n\n[brief summary of changes]\n\nChoose an option when done:",
     options=["Approve — mark spec as verified", "Fix — address my annotations from the Console", "Manual — I'll test manually and report back"]
   )
   ```

3. Handle response — **match strictly, never auto-approve ambiguous input:**
   - **Approve:** Response is one of: "Approve", "approve", "lgtm", "looks good", "continue", "proceed" → proceed to Step 3.14
   - **Fix:** Response matches "Fix" or mentions annotations/console feedback → re-run Step 3.12b (check for code review annotations in JSON), fix issues, re-run tests, return to Step 3.13
   - **Manual / custom text:** Response matches "Manual" OR is ANY other free-text/custom input → the user wants to pause. **Do NOT mark VERIFIED. Do NOT change plan status.** Use `AskUserQuestion` again (required so the stop guard allows the user to exit while waiting):
     ```
     AskUserQuestion(
       question="Take your time testing. When you're done, choose an option or describe any issues you found:",
       options=["Approve — mark spec as verified", "Issues found — describe below"]
     )
     ```
     Then **stop and wait** for the user's next message.
   - **⛔ After Manual wait — re-evaluation of follow-up:** When the user responds after a Manual pause:
     - Explicit approval ("approve", "lgtm", "looks good") → proceed to Step 3.14
     - **Any other content** (error descriptions, screenshots, images, bug reports, or ANY non-approval text) → treat as **bug reports to fix**. Investigate the reported issues, implement fixes, re-run tests, then return to Step 3.13 (ask again).
   - **⛔ NEVER treat ambiguous or custom responses as approval.** Only the explicit keywords listed under "Approve" advance to Step 3.14.

### Step 3.14: Update Plan Status

**When ALL passes AND user approves:**

1. Set `Status: VERIFIED` in plan
2. Register: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "VERIFIED" 2>/dev/null || true`
3. Report completion with summary:
   ```
   ## Verification Complete
   **Issues Found:** X
   ### Goal Achievement: N/M truths verified
   ### Must Fix (N) | Should Fix (N) | Suggestions (N)
   ### Not Verified: [list items from Step 3.8b, or "None"]
   ```

4. **Instruct the user:** Include in your completion message:
   ```
   Run /clear before starting new work — this resets context while keeping project rules loaded.
   ```

**When verification FAILS (missing features, serious bugs — before reaching Step 3.13):**

1. Add fix tasks to plan
2. Set `Status: PENDING`, increment `Iterations`
3. Register: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "PENDING" 2>/dev/null || true`
4. Write `## Verification Gaps` table to plan (overwrite if exists):
   ```markdown
   | Gap | Type | Severity | Affected Files | Fix Description |
   ```
5. Invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`
