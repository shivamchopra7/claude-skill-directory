## Output Schema

```json
{
  "counsel_id": "csl_abc123",
  "acknowledgment": "Checking the door 50 times... that's not something he chose. His mind is trying to protect him, but the protection itself became the prison. That exhaustion is real.",
  "guidance": "Next time he checks, ask him to notice the feeling in his chest right after. Not to stop it — just to notice. That tiny pause between urge and action is where freedom begins.",
  "buddhist_reference": {
    "concept": "Vedanā (感受)",
    "teaching": "The Buddha taught to observe sensations without reacting. The compulsion is driven by dukkha-vedanā. By observing it without acting, the cycle weakens naturally.",
    "source": "Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (MN 10)"
  },
  "persuasion_strategy": {
    "framework": "ACT + MI OARS",
    "techniques_used": [
      "Reflect (MI): Acknowledging exhaustion without judgment",
      "Defusion (ACT): Separating the person from the compulsion",
      "Tiny action (Nudge Theory): 'Just notice' instead of 'stop checking'"
    ]
  },
  "change_stage": "contemplation",
  "tone": "understanding",
  "safe_t": {
    "triggered": false,
    "severity": "moderate",
    "action": "proceed"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `counsel_id` | Unique response ID for audit |
| `acknowledgment` | Compassionate validation of suffering (Karuṇā + MI Reflect) |
| `guidance` | ONE tiny action — not a plan, not advice (Nudge Theory + Ehipassiko) |
| `buddhist_reference` | Pali/Sanskrit concept + teaching + sutta source |
| `persuasion_strategy` | Which frameworks were used and why |
| `change_stage` | TTM stage: precontemplation / contemplation / preparation / action / maintenance |
| `tone` | gentle / understanding / encouraging |
| `safe_t.triggered` | true if crisis detected (SAFE-T 3-layer detection) |
| `safe_t.severity` | none / low / moderate / high / critical |

## SAFE-T Crisis Detection

When `safe_t.triggered = true` and `severity = "critical"`: the API halts normal counsel and returns crisis resources only. Do NOT override this behavior.

| Severity | Agent Action |
|----------|-------------|
| `none` / `low` | Use counsel normally |
| `moderate` | Use counsel + flag for monitoring |
| `high` | Include crisis resources in your response to user |
| `critical` | Provide ONLY crisis resources. Do not paraphrase or add guidance. |

## What This Service NEVER Does

| Prohibited | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| "You should..." / "You need to..." | Directive advice causes disengagement (JMIR 2025) |
| "You can do it!" / "Stay positive!" | Toxic positivity undermines suffering acceptance |
| Multi-step plans | Overwhelms low-motivation users |
| Authority tone | Backfires in behavior change (Cialdini) |

## Pricing
