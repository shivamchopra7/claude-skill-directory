## Purpose

Automate Facebook and Instagram content creation for multi-platform social media presence. This skill generates platform-optimized posts that maintain brand consistency, follow platform-specific best practices, and require human approval before publishing.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when:
- User asks to "post to Facebook" or "post to Instagram"
- Creating content for community engagement
- Sharing business updates across multiple platforms
- Building brand awareness visually (Instagram) or through community (Facebook)
- Cross-posting content with platform optimization
- Scheduling regular social media updates
- Promoting services, achievements, or behind-the-scenes content

## Workflow Overview

```
Business_Goals.md → Platform Selection → Content Type
        ↓                    ↓                ↓
Platform Guidelines → Content Generation → Image Selection
        ↓                    ↓                ↓
Hashtag Strategy → Optimization → Approval Request
        ↓                    ↓                ↓
Human Approval → Multi-Platform Publishing → Engagement Tracking
```

## Platform Differences (Critical)

### Facebook
- **Optimal Length:** 40-80 words (can go longer for stories)
- **Hashtags:** 1-2 hashtags (low usage, not critical)
- **Focus:** Community engagement, conversation starters
- **Best Times:** Tuesday-Thursday 1-4 PM, Saturday 12-1 PM
- **Content Style:** Conversational, community-focused, discussion prompts
- **Character Limit:** 63,206 (but shorter performs better)

### Instagram
- **Optimal Length:** Short captions (125-150 characters for feeds) or longer storytelling
- **Hashtags:** 5-10 relevant hashtags (critical for discovery)
- **Focus:** Visual storytelling, aesthetic consistency
- **Best Times:** Monday/Wednesday 11 AM-1 PM, Friday 10-11 AM
- **Content Style:** Visual-first, aspirational, behind-the-scenes
- **Character Limit:** 2,200 for captions

**Key Insight:** NEVER create identical content for both platforms. Each requires platform-specific optimization.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Content Discovery & Platform Selection

**Objective:** Identify content-worthy activities and determine optimal platform(s).

1. **Read Business_Goals.md**
   ```bash
   # Location: Vault/Business_Goals.md
   # Look for: Active projects, target audience, content themes
   ```
   - Identify current business priorities
   - Check social media goals (engagement targets, brand awareness)
   - Note preferred content types

2. **Scan Recent Completed Tasks**
   ```bash
   # Location: Vault/Done/
   # Pattern: Visual-worthy achievements, team activities, client projects
   ```
   - Look for visually interesting content (Instagram)
   - Find conversation starters or community-relevant topics (Facebook)
   - Identify behind-the-scenes moments

3. **Check Explicit Content Requests**
   ```bash
   # Location: Vault/Needs_Action/
   # Pattern: Social media post requests
   ```
   - Extract platform preference (Facebook, Instagram, or both)
   - Note any specific images or angles requested

4. **Platform Selection Logic**

   Use [platform-selection.md](./reference/platform-selection.md):

   **Choose Facebook when:**
   - Content sparks discussion or community engagement
   - Sharing longer-form stories or updates
   - Targeting local community or specific groups
   - Text-heavy content with minimal visual requirements

   **Choose Instagram when:**
   - Content is highly visual (product shots, workspace, team photos)
   - Targeting younger or design-conscious audience
   - Building aesthetic brand consistency
   - Showcasing portfolio work or creative process

   **Choose Both when:**
   - Major announcements or milestones
   - Content works well visually AND as discussion starter
   - Maximizing reach across different audiences
   - *Note: MUST create platform-specific versions*

**Output:** Platform(s) selected, content theme identified

---

### Phase 2: Content Generation (Platform-Optimized)

**Objective:** Create engaging, platform-specific content.

#### For Facebook Posts

1. **Select Facebook Template**

   Refer to [facebook-guidelines.md](./reference/facebook-guidelines.md):

   - **Community Question:** Spark discussion with open-ended question
   - **Behind-the-Scenes:** Share process, team culture, work environment
   - **Milestone Celebration:** Achievements with community appreciation
   - **Value/Tip Share:** Helpful advice or industry insights
   - **Event/Announcement:** Business updates, launches, events

2. **Draft Facebook Content**

   Structure (40-80 words optimal):
   ```markdown
   [Hook - question or relatable statement]

   [Context - brief story or background]

   [Call-to-Action - encourage comments/shares]

   #hashtag1 #hashtag2 (optional, max 2)
   ```

   **Facebook Voice Guidelines:**
   - Conversational and friendly
   - Ask questions to encourage comments
   - Use personal pronouns (we, our, you)
   - Create sense of community
   - Authentic and approachable

#### For Instagram Posts

1. **Select Instagram Template**

   Refer to [instagram-guidelines.md](./reference/instagram-guidelines.md):

   - **Visual Showcase:** Portfolio work, product shots, design
   - **Carousel Story:** Multi-image narrative or tutorial
   - **Motivational Quote:** Branded quote graphic with caption
   - **Behind-the-Scenes:** Candid workspace, process shots
   - **User-Generated Content:** Client results, testimonials (with permission)

2. **Draft Instagram Caption**

   Structure (flexible length):
   ```markdown
   [Visual Description OR Hook] (emojis acceptable)

   [Story/Value - 2-4 sentences]

   [Call-to-Action - tag friends, save post, visit link in bio]

   •
   •
   •
   #hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5
   #hashtag6 #hashtag7 #hashtag8 (5-10 total)
   ```

   **Instagram Voice Guidelines:**
   - Visual-first (caption complements image)
   - Emojis acceptable and encouraged (2-5)
   - Line breaks for readability (use • • • separator before hashtags)
   - Storytelling or inspirational tone
   - Strategic hashtag use for discovery

3. **Hashtag Strategy**

   Use [hashtag-library.md](./reference/hashtag-library.md):

   **Facebook:** 1-2 broad hashtags (low priority)
   - Example: #SmallBusiness #Entrepreneurship

   **Instagram:** 5-10 mix of sizes (critical)
   - 2-3 niche hashtags (10K-100K posts) - your specific industry
   - 3-4 medium hashtags (100K-500K posts) - broader topics
   - 1-2 popular hashtags (1M+ posts) - discovery
   - Always include your branded hashtag
   - Example: #FreelanceDesigner #BrandIdentity #DesignProcess #CreativeStudio #SmallBusinessDesign #GraphicDesign

**Output:** Platform-specific drafted content with hashtags

---

### Phase 3: Visual Content Planning

**Objective:** Identify or specify required images/graphics.

1. **Image Requirements Check**

   **Facebook:**
   - Optional but recommended (2-3x higher engagement)
   - Recommended size: 1200x630px (link previews)
   - Formats: JPG, PNG, GIF

   **Instagram:**
   - REQUIRED (visual-first platform)
   - Feed post: 1080x1080px (square) or 1080x1350px (portrait)
   - Carousel: Multiple 1080x1080px images
   - Formats: JPG, PNG

2. **Image Source Identification**

   Check in priority order:
   ```bash
   # 1. Vault/Social_Media/Images/ - pre-approved images
   # 2. Vault/Projects/[project-name]/ - project screenshots
   # 3. Request from user - if no suitable image found
   ```

3. **Image Optimization**

   If image found, use image optimizer:
   ```bash
   python scripts/image_optimizer.py --input "path/to/image.jpg" --platform [facebook|instagram]
   ```

   The optimizer will:
   - Resize to platform-optimal dimensions
   - Compress for fast loading (< 1MB)
   - Add subtle branding if configured
   - Output to `/Vault/Social_Media/[Platform]/Ready/`

4. **Image Requirement Documentation**

   If no suitable image available:
   - Include in approval request: "IMAGE REQUIRED: [description]"
   - Suggest image type or content
   - Provide reference examples if applicable

**Output:** Image identified/optimized OR image requirement documented

---

### Phase 4: Quality Review & Validation

   - [ ] Platform best practices followed

**Output:** Validated content ready for approval request

---

### Phase 5: Approval Request Creation

   [Space for human to edit content or image selection before approval]
   ```

3. **File Naming Convention**
   ```
   APPROVAL_SOCIAL_[FB|IG|BOTH]_[description]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md

   Examples:
   - APPROVAL_SOCIAL_FB_TeamMilestone_2026-01-11.md
   - APPROVAL_SOCIAL_IG_ProductShowcase_2026-01-11.md
   - APPROVAL_SOCIAL_BOTH_MajorAnnouncement_2026-01-11.md
   ```

   ```bash
   # Location: Vault/Pending_Approval/
   ```

**Output:** Approval request file created in /Pending_Approval

---

### Phase 6: Dashboard Logging

**Objective:** Maintain audit trail and activity log.

Update `Vault/Dashboard.md`:

```markdown
## Recent Activity

- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] **Social Media Post Created**
  - Platform: [Facebook / Instagram / Both]
  - Topic: [Brief description]
  - Image: [Ready / Required]
  - Status: Pending Approval
  - Approval File: APPROVAL_SOCIAL_[...]_[date].md
  - Action: Human review required in /Pending_Approval
```

**Output:** Dashboard updated with pending post status

---

### Phase 7: Post-Approval Execution

**Note:** Executes ONLY after human moves approval file to `/Approved` folder.

1. **Detect Approved Post**
   ```bash
   # Monitor: Vault/Approved/
   # Pattern: APPROVAL_SOCIAL_*.md
   ```

2. **Execute Platform Publishing**

   **For Facebook:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/facebook_api_helper.py --approval-file "Vault/Approved/APPROVAL_SOCIAL_FB_xxx.md"
   ```

   **For Instagram:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/instagram_api_helper.py --approval-file "Vault/Approved/APPROVAL_SOCIAL_IG_xxx.md"
   ```

   The scripts will:
   - Extract post content and image path
   - Authenticate with Facebook/Instagram Graph API
   - Publish the post(s)
   - Return post URLs and status

3. **Handle Execution Results**

   **If Success:**
   - Move approval file from `/Approved` to `/Done`
   - Update Dashboard with success log and post URLs
   - Initialize engagement tracking file in `/Social_Media/[Platform]/Analytics/`

   **If Failure:**
   - Keep file in `/Approved`
   - Log error to Dashboard with details
   - Create troubleshooting task in /Needs_Action

4. **Engagement Tracking Setup**

   Create tracking file:
   ```markdown
   # /Vault/Social_Media/[Platform]/Analytics/POST_[date]_[topic].md

   ---
   platform: [facebook|instagram]
   post_url: [URL]
   published: [timestamp]
   ---

   ## Initial Metrics (24h)
   - Likes: [TBD - check after 24h]
   - Comments: [TBD]

## Integration with Other Skills

### Required Dependencies

1. **handle-approval Skill** (Gold Branch 1)
   - MUST be used for all approval request creation
   - Enforces security thresholds
   - Manages expiration policies

### Optional Integrations

2. **create-plan Skill** (Silver Tier)
   - Use for content calendar planning
   - Schedule multi-platform campaigns

3. **process-tasks Skill** (Bronze Tier)
   - Process explicit social media requests from /Needs_Action

---

## Security & Safety Protocols

### Never Auto-Approve

- ALL social media posts REQUIRE human approval (zero exceptions)
- Public-facing content is permanent
- Brand reputation risk is HIGH
- Approval expiration: 72 hours (3 days)

### Content Validation Required

Before creating approval request:
- [ ] No confidential business information
- [ ] No client names/data without explicit permission
- [ ] No controversial, political, or divisive content
- [ ] No negative comments about competitors or industry peers
- [ ] Professional and inclusive language
- [ ] Image rights verified (own content or licensed)
- [ ] Platform community guidelines compliant

### Rate Limiting

From `Business_Goals.md` (adjust as needed):
- **Facebook:** 3-5 posts per week maximum
- **Instagram:** 4-7 posts per week maximum (daily acceptable)
- **Minimum Spacing:** 4 hours between posts on same platform
- **Cross-posting:** Stagger Facebook and Instagram by 2+ hours

---

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **No Suitable Visual Content Found (Instagram)**
   - Action: Document image requirement in approval request
   - Provide: Suggested image type and references
   - User: Must provide image before approval

2. **Business_Goals.md Missing Social Media Section**
   - Action: Alert user to define social media strategy
   - Fallback: Use Company_Handbook brand themes
   - Default: Conservative posting frequency (2-3x/week)

3. **Facebook/Instagram API Authentication Failure**
   - Action: Log error with details
   - Alert: Create task in /Needs_Action for token refresh
   - Guidance: Link to OAuth troubleshooting guide

4. **Image Optimization Script Failure**
   - Action: Use original image if within size limits
   - Log: Warning about unoptimized image
   - Fallback: Request manual image preparation

5. **Hashtag Library Empty**
   - Facebook: Skip hashtags (not critical)
   - Instagram: Use generic industry hashtags
   - Alert: Recommend populating hashtag library

---

## Testing & Validation

### Dry-Run Mode

Both API helper scripts support dry-run:
```bash
python scripts/facebook_api_helper.py --dry-run --approval-file "path/to/file.md"
python scripts/instagram_api_helper.py --dry-run --approval-file "path/to/file.md"
```

This will:
- Parse approval file
- Validate content and image
- Show what would be posted
- NOT publish to platforms

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Platform-specific content generated correctly
- [ ] Hashtag strategy appropriate per platform
- [ ] Image requirements identified or images attached
- [ ] Approval request in correct format
- [ ] Dashboard logging complete
- [ ] Content passes quality checklist
