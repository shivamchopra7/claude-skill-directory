# Competitor Tracker

Monitor and analyze competitors' influencer marketing: who they partner with, what campaigns they run, how they structure collaborations, and what results they appear to achieve.

## Quick Start

Shortest invocation:

```
Monitor [competitor name]'s influencer marketing activities
```

Compare a set of rivals and surface gaps:

```
Compare influencer strategies across [competitor 1], [competitor 2], and [competitor 3], then show me which influencers they're missing in [category]
```

## Skill Contract

- **Reads**: your brand name, the competitor set, platforms to monitor, time period, focus areas (partnerships/campaigns/content/all). Public creator handles and post data the user supplies or that ~~social platform analytics returns.
- **Writes**: a competitive intelligence report saved to `memory/influencer/competitor-tracker/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (partnership roster, campaign analysis, content-strategy review, performance estimates, side-by-side comparison, opportunity list).
- **Promotes**: durable facts (named competitors, their primary tiers/platforms, confirmed exclusive partners, recurring campaign windows) to `memory/hot-cache.md`. Competitor-partner and exclusivity flags for creators already on the roster go as one-line updates to `memory/events/creators.ndjson` via an authorized `operation: propose` request to `registry-events.py` for [creator-registry](../../../protocol/creator-registry/SKILL.md) to reconcile.
- **Done when**:
  1. Each tracked competitor has a partnership roster and campaign breakdown with sources or stated estimates.
  2. A side-by-side comparison table covers your brand plus every competitor.
  3. At least 3 ranked opportunities (untapped creators, strategy gaps, or open platforms) are listed.
- **Primary next skill**: [campaign-planner](../campaign-planner/SKILL.md)

### Handoff Summary

> Emit the standard shape from [skill-contract.md §Handoff Summary Format](../../../references/skill-contract.md).

## Data Sources

This family is Tier 1 — it works with no live integrations. Ask the user for the competitor set, the platforms, and any creator handles they already know, then build the analysis from public posts and stated estimates.

Where a tool could speed things up, use `~~` connector placeholders:

- `~~influencer database` — pull a competitor's known partner roster and tier mix.
- `~~social platform analytics` — estimate reach, engagement rate, and post cadence per creator.
- `~~CRM` — cross-check whether a former competitor partner has already touched your pipeline.

**Keyless news read on rivals**: `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/connectors/gdelt.py" '"<competitor>"' --days 30` lists a rival's global news coverage with no key — campaign launches, partnership announcements, PR pushes — **Measured** from GDELT's news index (news media only, not social posts; ≥5s between calls). See [scripts/connectors/README.md](../../../scripts/connectors/README.md).

**Rival-partner channel watch (free key / keyless)**: `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/connectors/youtube.py" channel <partner-handle>` reads a competitor partner's real subscriber/view counts (free `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`), and every YouTube channel also has a **keyless RSS feed** — `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC…` piped into `rss_monitor.py` — for tracking partner posting cadence and spotting a burst of sponsored content without any API at all.

Label every estimate as an estimate. See [CONNECTORS.md](../../../CONNECTORS.md) for the keyless/free recipe per category.

## Instructions

Each step has a fill-in template in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).

1. **Define competitive set** — capture your brand, prioritized competitors (direct/indirect), platforms, time period, and focus areas. ([template](references/templates.md#1-define-competitive-set))
2. **Track influencer partnerships** — for each competitor, build a current/recent partner roster (handle, platform, followers, partnership type, duration), then the observed selection criteria, relationship-type mix, partnership frequency, and notable partners. ([template](references/templates.md#2-track-influencer-partnerships))
3. **Analyze campaigns** — break down recent campaigns (timeline, platforms, tier mix, content type, hashtag, CTA, estimated spend, what worked/didn't), plus a calendar and seasonal/launch patterns. ([template](references/templates.md#3-analyze-campaigns))
4. **Review content strategy** — log format preferences, content themes, messaging, hashtag strategy, and creative direction. ([template](references/templates.md#4-review-content-strategy))
5. **Estimate performance** — estimate overall program metrics, performance by platform and by tier, and top/underperforming content. Mark every figure as an estimate. ([template](references/templates.md#5-estimate-performance))
6. **Generate competitive comparison** — a side-by-side table (your brand + every competitor), a strategy-element matrix, and a share-of-voice bar. ([template](references/templates.md#6-generate-competitive-comparison))
7. **Identify opportunities** — rank untapped and former-competitor creators, strategy gaps, and platform/niche/format openings (at least 3 ranked). ([template](references/templates.md#7-identify-opportunities))
8. **Generate insights report** — executive summary, strategic recommendations (immediate/short/long-term), tracking recommendations, and next review date. Save to the memory path above. ([template](references/templates.md#8-generate-insights-report))
