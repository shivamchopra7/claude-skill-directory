# Content Amplifier

Extract more value from live, approved creator content. Two modes: **paid** (extend reach with paid spend — whitelisting, Spark Ads, dark posts, budget + optimization) and **repurpose** (reuse one asset across paid, website, email, and social — inventory, repurposing map, format specs, distribution plan). Both start from content that is already published and cleared; neither reviews whether the content is publishable — that gate is [content-reviewer](../content-reviewer/SKILL.md).

**Scope guard**: this skill does NOT score a deliverable for brand alignment, message accuracy, or FTC/disclosure compliance, and it does NOT compute a C³ ART score or run the T1/T2 veto — that is the [content-reviewer](../content-reviewer/SKILL.md) gate's job. This skill works the downstream lever: turning approved content into paid reach or many-channel assets, then hands off.

## Mode selector

| Mode | Use when | Core output |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **paid** (default) | Extend the reach of organic creator content with paid spend | Content-selection scorecard, amplification strategy (whitelisting / boosting / dark posts), audience targeting, budget allocation, optimization playbook |
| **repurpose** | Reuse one approved asset across paid, website, email, and social | Rights-tracked inventory, 1-video-to-10+ repurposing map, format transformation specs, 30-day distribution plan, content library + rights tracker |

Pick with `--mode paid` or `--mode repurpose`. If unset: "boost / amplify / whitelisting / Spark Ads / dark post / paid spend / budget" → **paid**; "repurpose / reuse / turn one video into many / asset library / social proof on pages / multi-channel rollout" → **repurpose**. If the request spans both (e.g. "cut ad variations *and* plan the paid spend"), run **repurpose** first to produce the assets, then hand to **paid** — do not silently merge; state which mode you ran.

## Quick Start

Shortest invocation:

```
Which influencer content should we amplify from [campaign]?          # paid
How can we repurpose this influencer content across channels?        # repurpose
```

Common scenarios:

```
--mode paid: Create a paid amplification plan for our influencer campaign with $5,000 across TikTok and Instagram
--mode repurpose: We have 3 great TikTok videos. Build a repurposing plan and a 30-day distribution calendar.
```

Output expectation — **paid**: every candidate scored, tiered, and given a spend that sums to budget, plus a scale/pause playbook. **repurpose**: every source asset rights-tagged, at least one mapped to 3+ formats across 2+ channels, plus a dated distribution plan.

## Skill Contract

- **Reads**:
  - *paid* — organic content set (creator handles, platform, content type, reach, engagement rate, views), amplification budget, campaign objective (awareness/traffic/conversions), target platforms, any prior performance data the user provides.
  - *repurpose* — source UGC assets (videos, reels, reviews, images), creator handles and platforms, usage rights per asset, original performance metrics, target channels. For atomizing a source, the pasted transcript/caption/review text.
  - Both pull prior campaign context from `memory/hot-cache.md` when `memory-management` is active.
- **Writes**: the mode's deliverable (paid: selection scorecard, strategy, targeting, budget, optimization playbook; repurpose: inventory, repurposing map, distribution plan, format specs, rights tracker) plus a reusable handoff summary. Save to `memory/influencer/content-amplifier/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
- **Promotes**: durable facts — *paid*: chosen amplification mix, per-creator spend tiers, winning audiences, scale/pause thresholds; *repurpose*: rights levels, expiration dates, library naming convention, top-performing source assets — to `memory/hot-cache.md` (ask first).
- **Done when**:
  - *paid* — (1) each candidate is scored /25 and tiered (must amplify / consider / do not amplify) with a recommended spend; (2) a budget allocation by content, objective, and platform sums to the stated budget; (3) an optimization plan with KPI targets and scale/pause rules is recorded.
  - *repurpose* — (1) every source asset has a rights level and expiration recorded; (2) at least one source asset is mapped to 3+ distinct output formats across 2+ channels; (3) a dated distribution plan with an asset checklist exists.
- **Primary next skill**: *paid* → [performance-analyzer](../../measure/performance-analyzer/SKILL.md) once campaigns are live; *repurpose* → [landing-optimizer](../../measure/landing-optimizer/SKILL.md) to place the repurposed social proof where it converts.

### Handoff Summary

> Emit the standard shape from [skill-contract.md §Handoff Summary Format](../../../references/skill-contract.md). State which mode ran. Label every metric Measured / User-provided / Estimated — never present a CPM, ROAS, view count, or rights date you were not given as Measured; if it is missing, ask for the export or mark it Estimated with the basis.

## Data Sources

This family is Tier 1: both modes work with no live integrations. Ask the user for the mode's inputs and produce the full artifact from those. Never invent reach, engagement, CPM, ROAS, or rights numbers — if a value is missing, ask for the export or label it Estimated.

Where a connector could sharpen the output (all optional, opt-in Tier 2/3):

- `~~social platform analytics` — pull organic reach, engagement rate, and view counts (both modes) instead of asking the user to paste them.
- `~~ad platform` (Meta Ads Manager, TikTok Ads Manager, Google Ads) — read live CPM/CTR/CPC/ROAS for the paid optimization playbook, and confirm Spark Ads / Partnership Ad authorization status.
- `~~influencer database` — verify creator audience demographics for lookalike targeting (paid); pull handles, platforms, and contract rights terms (repurpose).
- `~~DAM / asset library` — store and tag processed assets; enforce the naming convention (repurpose).
- `~~CRM` — supply retargeting/exclusion audiences (paid); reconcile creator records with usage-rights expirations (repurpose).

See [CONNECTORS.md](../../../CONNECTORS.md) for the verified free/keyless recipe per category. None are required; absent a connector, the user supplies the numbers.

## Instructions

Select the mode first (see Mode selector), then run that mode's steps. Each step has a fill-in template in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) — produce the populated artifact, do not skip the table.

### Mode: paid

1. **Assess available content** — build the content inventory: campaign, piece count, budget, and a performance overview table (creator, platform, type, organic reach, ER, views, potential). [Paid Step 1 template](references/templates.md#paid-1-content-inventory-step-1).
2. **Select content for amplification** — weight selection criteria (organic performance, hook quality, message clarity, production quality, CTA), score each piece /25, then tier into Must Amplify / Consider If Budget Allows / Do Not Amplify with recommended spend. [Paid Step 2 template](references/templates.md#paid-2-content-selection-step-2).
3. **Develop amplification strategy** — pick the mix across three methods: whitelisting / Spark Ads (run through the creator's account, best for native feel and social proof), brand account boosting (full targeting control, less authentic), and dark posts (test variations, specific targeting). Output a budget-split table by method. [Paid Step 3 template](references/templates.md#paid-3-amplification-strategy-step-3-method-detail).
4. **Set up targeting** — primary lookalike off the creator's engaged audience, plus expansion segments (interest/behavioral/demographic for awareness; retargeting/custom/lookalike for conversions), ad sets per platform, and exclusions. [Paid Step 4 template](references/templates.md#paid-4-audience-targeting-step-4).
5. **Allocate budget** — split the stated budget by content, by objective, and by platform (with CPM estimates), and set a pacing schedule (learning → optimization → scaling). Allocations must sum to the stated budget. [Paid Step 5 template](references/templates.md#paid-5-budget-allocation-step-5).
6. **Optimization playbook** — KPI table (CPM, CTR, CPC, CVR, ROAS) with below/above-target actions, an optimization schedule, A/B tests, and explicit scale-up / pause / creative-refresh thresholds. [Paid Step 6 template](references/templates.md#paid-6-optimization-playbook-step-6).
7. **Platform-specific setup** — creator authorization + campaign steps for Meta Partnership Ads, TikTok Spark Ads, and YouTube video ads. [Paid Step 7 guide](references/templates.md#paid-7-platform-specific-setup-step-7).

Save the populated artifact and (with the user's OK) promote the chosen mix, per-creator spend tiers, winning audiences, and scale/pause thresholds.

### Mode: repurpose

1. **Audit available content** — build a content inventory and rights summary: every asset gets an ID, creator, platform, type, rights level, and status. [Repurpose Step 1 template](references/templates.md#repurpose-1-content-inventory-step-1).
2. **Map repurposing opportunities** — for each source asset, list output formats, target channels, modifications, and effort (one video → 10+ assets). [Repurpose Step 2 template](references/templates.md#repurpose-2-repurposing-opportunity-map-step-2).
3. **Create the repurposing plan** — rank source assets by performance and rights, then lay out a channel distribution plan across paid, owned, social, and sales. [Repurpose Step 3 template](references/templates.md#repurpose-3-repurposing-plan-step-3).
4. **Specify format transformations** — give aspect ratio, duration, and modification specs for video→video, video→static, quote/review, and image conversions. Per-platform specs live in [references/platforms/](../../../references/platforms). [Repurpose Step 4 specs](references/templates.md#repurpose-4-format-transformation-specs-step-4).
5. **Apply channel guidelines** — website, email, paid (incl. a creative testing matrix), and organic social best practices. [Repurpose Step 5 guidelines](references/templates.md#repurpose-5-channel-specific-guidelines-step-5).
6. **Build the content library** — folder structure, the `[campaign]_[creator]_[platform]_[type]_[variation]_[date]` naming convention, and metadata fields. [Repurpose Step 6 structure](references/templates.md#repurpose-6-content-library-structure-step-6).
7. **Track rights** — rights-by-content matrix, expiring-rights alerts, and rights-expansion opportunities. [Repurpose Step 7 tracker](references/templates.md#repurpose-7-usage-rights-tracker-step-7).

For slicing one source into many output atoms, apply the 7-tier extraction and near-duplicate flag in [references/atom-extraction.md](references/atom-extraction.md). Save the populated artifact and (with the user's OK) promote rights levels, expiration dates, the library naming convention, and top-performing source assets.

## Decision Gates

- **Stop and ask** — only when a mode input needed to proceed is missing and not inferable: (1) *paid* has no budget and none can be inferred — ask for the amplification budget; (2) *repurpose* has assets whose usage rights are unknown — ask for the rights level before recommending any ad/website/email reuse, because reusing a rights-restricted asset is a compliance risk you must not guess through.
- **Continue silently** — do not stop for: which 3 of N pieces to deep-dive (pick by performance); missing optional connector data (mark N/A, ask the user for the numbers, proceed); a platform not in the reference set (apply the nearest analog and note it). Missing organic metrics → ask once, then proceed with the pieces you have, labeling gaps.

## Example

**paid** — *User*: "We have 5 influencer TikToks from our launch campaign. Which should we amplify with our $5,000 paid budget?"

```markdown
| Creator | Views | ER | Hook | Amplify? | Budget |
|---------|-------|-----|------|----------|--------|
| @creator1 | 245K | 8.2% | 5/5 | Yes | $2,000 |
| @creator3 | 89K | 6.5% | 4/5 | Yes | $1,500 |
| @creator4 | 34K | 9.8% | 4/5 | Yes | $800 |
| @creator2 | 156K | 4.1% | 3/5 | Maybe | $500 |
| @creator5 | 67K | 2.3% | 2/5 | No | $0 |
Testing reserve $200. Get Spark Ads auth from top 3; run @creator1 as awareness,
@creator3 as traffic; scale winners after the 3-day learning phase.
```

**repurpose** — *User*: "We have 3 great TikTok videos. How should we repurpose them?" → 3 clips ranked; @creator1's 45s demo expands to 6 assets (Spark Ad, IG Reel, website embed, 3 stills, 15s Stories cut), backed by a 30-day calendar and asset checklist.

## Save Results

After delivering findings, ask: "Save these results for future sessions?" If yes, write `memory/influencer/content-amplifier/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` with: one-line verdict/headline, top 3-5 actionable items, open loops or blockers, and source data references. Only the auditor-class gates may write memory without asking — this skill asks first, and hands veto-like risks (missing disclosure, unsubstantiated claims) to [content-reviewer](../content-reviewer/SKILL.md) rather than judging them here.

## Next Best Skill

**Primary**:
- *paid mode* → [performance-analyzer](../../measure/performance-analyzer/SKILL.md) — measure amplification results once campaigns are live.
- *repurpose mode* → [landing-optimizer](../../measure/landing-optimizer/SKILL.md) — drop the repurposed testimonials, hero videos, and quote cards onto the pages that convert.

**Alternates**:
- [content-amplifier --mode paid](SKILL.md) — when repurposed ad variations are ready for paid spend (run only if repurpose ran this session and paid has not).
- [contract-helper](../contract-helper/SKILL.md) — secure or expand usage rights before reuse (repurpose).
- [budget-optimizer](../../plan/budget-optimizer/SKILL.md) — reallocate paid budget across the recommended tiers (paid).

**Termination**: maintain a visited-set this session. If a recommended target (including the sibling mode of this skill) already ran, STOP and report the chain complete rather than re-invoking it. Max chain depth 3. When routing is ambiguous, present the options and stop instead of auto-following.
