# Trend Discovery

Find trends a brand can use without producing a generic list of popular hashtags.

## Inputs

- Brand, category, audience, market, and platforms.
- Decision horizon: react this week, plan next month, or shape a quarter.
- Optional competitor and creator seed list.

## Workflow

1. Build search seeds from category language, problems, desired outcomes, products, competitors, creators, and adjacent interests.
2. Use `scrapecreators-api` to collect relevant TikTok trend feeds, songs, song-linked videos, hashtags and creators; Instagram trending Reels, audio and search results; YouTube trending Shorts and search results; and Reddit or Pinterest discovery signals where the category warrants them.
3. Compare the recent window with a baseline. A trend must show acceleration, cross-account repetition, or migration across platforms—not merely high lifetime views.
4. Use `outlier-post-finder` and `transcript-intelligence` to understand the content, not just the metric.
5. Keep topic, sound, format, creator, and search-demand signals distinct. Classify each as emerging, accelerating, established, fading, or seasonal. Score brand fit, audience fit, regional relevance, shelf life, production effort, and reputational risk.
6. Turn the best signals into a response: participate, adapt the format, answer the question, create an evergreen variant, or ignore.

## Output

- Coverage and baseline.
- Ranked trend table with evidence, source links, stage, confidence, shelf life, and brand fit.
- Format/audio/topic patterns.
- Five recommended content tests with a clear reason and timing.
- Watchlist and false positives.

Do not claim a trend from one viral post. Label directional evidence and missing data.
