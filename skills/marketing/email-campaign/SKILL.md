# Email Campaign - Build Verified Email Lists

## Setup

Read your credentials from ~/.gooseworks/credentials.json:
```bash
export GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY=$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HOME/.gooseworks/credentials.json'))['api_key'])")
export GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE=$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HOME/.gooseworks/credentials.json')).get('api_base','https://api.gooseworks.ai'))")
```

If ~/.gooseworks/credentials.json does not exist, tell the user to run: `npx gooseworks login`

All endpoints use Bearer auth: `-H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY"`


Build targeted email campaigns with verified email addresses and personalized outreach.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find Emails by Domain
Get all emails for target companies:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"hunter","path":"/v2/domain-search","query":{"domain":"stripe.com"}}'
```

### Step 2: Find Specific Person's Email
Find email for specific contacts:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"hunter","path":"/v2/email-finder","query":{"domain":"stripe.com","first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe"}}'
```

### Step 3: Verify Emails
Check deliverability before sending:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"hunter","path":"/v2/email-verifier","query":{"email":"john@stripe.com"}}'
```

### Step 4: Batch Verification with Fiber
Validate multiple emails:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"fiber","path":"/v1/validate-email/single","body":{"email":"john@stripe.com"}}'
```

### Step 5: Enrich for Personalization
Get info for personalized outreach:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"sixtyfour","path":"/enrich-lead"}'
  "lead_info": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "company": "Stripe"
  },
  "struct": {"email": "Work email", "phone": "Phone number"}
}'
```

### Step 6: Get Company Context
Research company for personalization:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"brand-dev","path":"/v1/brand/retrieve","query":{"domain":"stripe.com"}}'
```

## Campaign Building Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Find target companies
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"fiber","path":"/v1/company-search"}'
  "searchParams": {
    "industries": ["SaaS"],
    "employee_count_min": 50,
    "employee_count_max": 500
  }
}'

# 2. Get emails for each company
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"hunter","path":"/v2/domain-search","query":{"domain":"company.com"}}'

# 3. Verify each email
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"hunter","path":"/v2/email-verifier","query":{"email":"person@company.com"}}'

# 4. Enrich for personalization
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"sixtyfour","path":"/enrich-lead","body":{"lead_info":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe","company":"Company"},"struct":{"email":"Work email"}}}'
```

List all endpoints, or add a path for parameter details:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"brand-dev API endpoints"}' api show fiber
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"hunter API endpoints"}' api show sixtyfour
