   # Location: Vault/Business_Goals.md
   # Look for: Active projects, recent milestones, Q1 objectives
   ```
   - Identify current business priorities
   - Check active projects and their status
   - Review key metrics and achievements
   - Note any specific content themes

2. **Scan Recent Completed Tasks**
   ```bash
   # Location: Vault/Done/
   # Pattern: Files from last 7 days
   ```
   - Look for completed project deliverables
   - Identify client wins or successful outcomes
   - Find interesting technical challenges solved
   - Note any learning moments or insights gained

### Phase 2: Content Generation (Create Draft)

**Objective:** Generate engaging, professional post content.

1. **Select Appropriate Template**

   Refer to [post-templates.md](./reference/post-templates.md) and choose based on content type:

   - **Project Milestone:** For completed deliverables, launches, achievements
   - **Client Success Story:** For positive outcomes, testimonials, case studies
   - **Industry Insight/Tip:** For sharing expertise, lessons learned, advice
   - **Service Offering:** For highlighting capabilities, solutions, specializations
   - **Behind-the-Scenes:** For process insights, tools, methodologies

2. **Apply Content Guidelines**

   Follow [content-guidelines.md](./reference/content-guidelines.md):

   - **Brand Voice:** Professional, approachable, expert (not arrogant)
   - **Length:** 150-300 words (optimal for LinkedIn engagement)
   - **Structure:** Hook → Value → Call-to-Action
   - **Tone:** Helpful, insightful, authentic
   - **Emoji Usage:** Minimal and professional (1-2 max)

3. **Draft Post Content**

   Template structure:
   ```markdown
   [Hook - attention-grabbing opening]

   [Context - what happened / why it matters]

   [Value - insight, lesson, or benefit]

   [Call-to-Action - invite engagement]

   #hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
   ```

4. **Add Relevant Hashtags**

   - Mix: 2 industry-specific + 1 broad professional + 1-2 trending
   - Examples: #SoftwareDevelopment #AI #ProductivityHacks #TechLeadership

**Output:** Complete drafted LinkedIn post with hashtags

---

### Phase 3: Quality Review (Validate Content)

**Objective:** Ensure post meets quality standards before approval request.

1. **Check Against Company_Handbook.md**
   ```bash
   # Location: Vault/Company_Handbook.md
   # Section: Social Media Rules (if exists)
   ```
   - Verify compliance with brand guidelines
   - Check for prohibited topics
   - Confirm tone alignment
   - Validate professional standards

2. **Content Quality Checklist**

   - [ ] Length: 150-300 words
   - [ ] Clear value proposition (insight/lesson/benefit)
   - [ ] Professional tone maintained
   - [ ] No typos or grammatical errors
   - [ ] Call-to-action included
   - [ ] Hashtags relevant (3-5 total)
   - [ ] No controversial or prohibited topics

3. **Metadata Validation**

   - Platform: LinkedIn
   - Post type: Text update (image/video if specified)
   - Timing: Optimal posting time if scheduling
   - Target audience: Professional network

**Output:** Validated post ready for approval

---

### Phase 4: Approval Request Creation

**Objective:** Create formal approval request for human review.

1. **Integrate with handle-approval Skill**

   This skill MUST use the `handle-approval` skill (from Branch 1) to create approval requests.

   Reference: [handle-approval thresholds](../../handle-approval/reference/approval-thresholds.md)

2. **Create Approval File**

   Use [approval-template.md](../../handle-approval/reference/approval-template.md) as base:

   ```markdown
   ---
   type: approval_request
   action: social_media_post
   platform: linkedin
   created: [timestamp ISO 8601]
   expires: [72 hours from creation]
   priority: normal
   status: pending
   ---

   ## Action Summary
   Publish LinkedIn post: [One-line description of content]

   ## Post Content
   [Full drafted post with hashtags]

   ## Metadata
   - **Platform:** LinkedIn
   - **Post Type:** Text update
   - **Word Count:** [X words]
   - **Hashtags:** #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
   - **Character Count:** [X/3000]

   ## Context & Rationale
   - **Content Source:** [Project milestone / Achievement / Insight]
   - **Business Goal:** [Lead generation / Thought leadership / Engagement]
   - **Target Audience:** [Potential clients / Industry peers / General professional network]

   ## Risks & Considerations

   ## To Reject
   Move this file to `/Rejected` folder and add reason at bottom.

   ---
   ## Human Edits (Optional)
   [Space for human to edit post content before approval]
   ```

3. **File Naming Convention**
   ```
   APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_[short-description]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md

   Examples:
   - APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_ProjectAlphaMilestone_2026-01-11.md
   - APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_IndustryInsightAI_2026-01-11.md
   - APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_ClientSuccessStory_2026-01-11.md
   ```

4. **Save to Pending Approval Folder**
   ```bash
   # Location: Vault/Pending_Approval/
   # File: APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_[description]_[date].md
   ```

**Output:** Approval request file created in /Pending_Approval

---

### Phase 5: Dashboard Logging

**Objective:** Maintain audit trail and activity log.

Update `Vault/Dashboard.md` with structured entry:

```markdown
## Recent Activity

- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] **LinkedIn Post Created**
  - Topic: [Brief description]
  - Template: [Template type used]
  - Word Count: [X words]
  - Status: Pending Approval
  - Approval File: APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_[description]_[date].md
  - Action: Human review required in /Pending_Approval
```

**Output:** Dashboard updated with pending post status

---

### Phase 6: Post-Approval Execution (After Human Approval)

**Note:** This phase executes ONLY after human moves approval file to `/Approved` folder.

1. **Detect Approved Post**
   ```bash
   # Monitor: Vault/Approved/
   # Pattern: APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_*.md
   ```

2. **Execute LinkedIn Publishing**

   Call LinkedIn API helper script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/linkedin_api_helper.py --approval-file "Vault/Approved/APPROVAL_LINKEDIN_xxx.md"
   ```

   The script (located at `.claude/skills/post-to-linkedin/scripts/linkedin_api_helper.py`) will:
   - Extract post content from approval file
   - Authenticate with LinkedIn API
   - Publish the post
   - Return success/failure status

3. **Handle Execution Results**

   **If Success:**
   - Move approval file from `/Approved` to `/Done`
   - Update Dashboard with success log
   - Record LinkedIn post URL (if available)

   **If Failure:**
   - Keep file in `/Approved`
   - Log error to Dashboard
   - Create alert in /Needs_Action for troubleshooting

4. **Final Dashboard Update**
   ```markdown
   - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] **LinkedIn Post Published** ✓
     - Topic: [Brief description]
     - Post URL: [LinkedIn post URL]
     - Engagement: [Track later if analytics available]
     - Status: Complete
   ```

**Output:** Post published to LinkedIn and logged

---

## Security & Safety Protocols

### Never Auto-Approve

- All LinkedIn posts REQUIRE human approval (zero exceptions)
- Social media is public and permanent
- Brand reputation risk is HIGH
- Approval expiration: 72 hours (3 days)

### Content Validation Required

Before creating approval request:
- [ ] No confidential information disclosed
- [ ] No client names without permission
- [ ] No controversial or political content
- [ ] No negative comments about competitors
- [ ] Professional language throughout
- [ ] Aligned with brand voice guidelines

### Rate Limiting

- **Maximum Frequency:** 3 posts per week (per Business_Goals.md)
- **Minimum Spacing:** 24 hours between posts
- **Optimal Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM or 4-6 PM (business hours)

---

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **No Recent Content Found**
   - Action: Suggest creating general industry insight post
   - Template: Use "Industry Insight/Tip" template
   - Source: Company_Handbook expertise areas

2. **Business_Goals.md Missing**
   - Action: Alert user to create file
   - Fallback: Use Company_Handbook for content themes

3. **LinkedIn API Authentication Failure**
   - Action: Log error to Dashboard
   - Alert: Create troubleshooting task in /Needs_Action
   - Reference: Setup guide for re-authentication

4. **Approval File Format Invalid**
   - Action: Validate YAML frontmatter
   - Fix: Auto-correct common formatting issues
   - Log: Warning in Dashboard if corrections made

---

## Testing & Validation

### Dry-Run Mode

When testing, use the `--dry-run` flag in linkedin_api_helper.py:
```bash
python scripts/linkedin_api_helper.py --dry-run --approval-file "path/to/file.md"
```

This will:
- Parse the approval file
- Validate content
- Show what would be posted
- NOT actually publish to LinkedIn

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Post content generated successfully
- [ ] Template selection appropriate
- [ ] Hashtags relevant and not excessive
- [ ] Approval request created in correct format
- [ ] Dashboard logging complete
- [ ] Content passes quality checklist
