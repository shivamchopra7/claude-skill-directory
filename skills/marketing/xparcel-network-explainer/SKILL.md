## Purpose

Transform abstract shipping network concepts into concrete, visual explanations that help prospects and customers understand FirstMile's competitive advantage through:
1. **Accurate facility mapping** with real coordinates
2. **Package journey visualization** from origin to destination
3. **Zone-skip economics** showing cost/time savings
4. **Network comparison** (Select vs National routing)

## MCP Tools Required

| Tool | Server | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| `search_places` | google-maps-grounding | Find facility addresses |
| `compute_routes` | google-maps-grounding | Calculate transit paths |
| `maps_geocode` | google-maps-community | Convert addresses to coordinates |
| `maps_directions` | google-maps-community | Step-by-step routing |
| `maps_distance_matrix` | google-maps-community | Multi-point zone analysis |

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context
- Customer origin location (fulfillment center, warehouse)
- Primary destination regions (top states/zips from PLD)
- Service level requirements (Ground, Expedited, Priority)
- Current carrier for comparison baseline

### 2. Map the Journey
```
ORIGIN (Customer FC)
    ↓
FIRSTMILE INTAKE (Nearest hub)
    ↓
SELECT HUB (If applicable - metro injection)
    ↓
LAST MILE PARTNER (National network carrier)
    ↓
DESTINATION (End customer)
```

### 3. Generate Visualization Data
- Use `maps_geocode` for all facility coordinates
- Use `maps_directions` for actual routing paths
- Use `maps_distance_matrix` for zone analysis
- Calculate transit time windows per service level

### 4. Create Deliverables
- Network flow diagram with real locations
- Zone-skip savings calculation
- Transit time comparison table
- Facility proximity analysis

## Service Level SLAs (Reference)

| Service | Transit Window | Network | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Xparcel Ground | 3-8 business days | National + Select | Economy shipping |
| Xparcel Expedited | 2-5 business days | Select preferred | Faster ground |
| Xparcel Priority | 1-3 business days | Select + Premium | Time-critical |

## Key Principle

**Never name specific last-mile carriers** (UPS, FedEx, USPS). Use:
- "National network" = nationwide coverage, all ZIPs
- "Select network" = metro injection hubs for zone-skipping

## Reference Documents

- `references/00-facility-locations.md` - Hub coordinates and details
- `references/01-network-routing-logic.md` - Package flow decision tree
- `references/02-visualization-rubrics.md` - Quality scoring for outputs

## Integration Points

| Pipeline Stage | Use Case |
|----------------|----------|
| **Discovery (Stage 3)** | Explain network during 38 Questions |
| **Rate Creation (Stage 4)** | Show zone-skip savings potential |
| **Proposal (Stage 5)** | Visual network comparison in deck |
| **Implementation (Stage 7)** | Facility mapping for integration |

## Example Prompts

```
"Map a package journey from Ontario, CA fulfillment center to Miami, FL customer using Xparcel Expedited"

"Show zone-skip savings for a Dallas-based shipper sending to Northeast"

"Create a facility proximity analysis for a prospect in Chicago"

"Visualize the Select network hub coverage map"
```

## Quality Gates

Before delivering any network visualization:
1. [ ] All coordinates verified via Google Maps MCP
2. [ ] Transit times match SLA windows
3. [ ] No carrier names mentioned (National/Select only)
4. [ ] Zone-skip logic accurately represented
5. [ ] Facility addresses current and accurate
