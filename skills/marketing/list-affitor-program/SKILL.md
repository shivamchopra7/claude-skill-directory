# Affiliate Program Lister

Research an affiliate program from official sources and produce a verified, publish-ready
listing for [list.affitor.com](https://list.affitor.com). Every number comes from the
program's official affiliate page, network page, or pricing page. No guessing.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research

## When to Use

- User wants to add an affiliate program to list.affitor.com
- User wants to document a program's commission structure in a standard format
- User found a program and wants to create a shareable profile for other affiliates
- User is contributing to the community directory
- User says "list this program" or "add X to the directory"

## Input Schema

```
{
  program_name: string       # (required) Name of the affiliate program, e.g., "HeyGen"
  affiliate_link: string     # (optional) User's affiliate link to include in the listing
  niche: string              # (optional) Category hint, e.g., "AI video", "email marketing"
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm Program and Context

Confirm the program name with the user. Ask:
- Do you have an affiliate link for this program? (optional — used for verification only)
- What niche or category does it fall under? (helps with tagging)

If the user says "just list it" or provides enough context, skip questions and proceed.

### Step 2: Research from Official Sources

Research the program using only official, verifiable sources. Search in this order:

1. **Official affiliate/partner page** — `web_search "[program name] affiliate program"` or
   `web_search "[program name] partner program"`. This is the primary source for commission
   structure, cookie duration, payment terms, and signup link.

2. **Affiliate network page** — If the program runs through a network (ShareASale, CJ,
   Impact, PartnerStack, Rewardful, etc.), find the network listing for additional details.

3. **Official pricing page** — `web_search "[program name] pricing"`. Needed to calculate
   realistic earnings (commission % means nothing without knowing the price).

4. **Credibility signals** — Look for: number of customers, notable clients, funding raised,
   year founded, G2/Capterra rating, social proof. These go in the description.

For each data point, note the source. If a value cannot be verified from official sources,
mark it as "unverified" in the output.

### Step 3: Extract Listing Fields

Fill in the structured listing fields from the research:

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `name` | Official product name | Exact capitalization from their website |
| `url` | Product homepage | Main website, not affiliate signup page |
| `reward_type` | Affiliate page | One of: `cpc`, `cpl`, `cps_one_time`, `cps_recurring`, `cps_lifetime`, `other` |
| `reward_value` | Affiliate page | e.g., "30%", "$50", "$0.10 per click" |
| `reward_duration` | Affiliate page | For recurring: "12 months", "lifetime", etc. Omit for one-time |
| `cookie_days` | Affiliate page | Number only. If not stated, mark "unverified" and estimate from network norms |
| `tags` | Niche + features | 3-6 lowercase tags, e.g., `["ai", "video", "saas"]` |

**Reward type mapping:**
- "X% of each sale" (one purchase) → `cps_one_time`
- "X% recurring" or "X% for Y months" → `cps_recurring`
- "X% for life of customer" → `cps_lifetime`
- "Pay per lead / free trial signup" → `cpl`
- "Pay per click" → `cpc`
- Anything else → `other` (explain in description)

### Step 4: Write the Description

The description is structured markdown that helps affiliates decide if the program is worth
promoting. Write these sections in order:

**Opening (2-3 sentences)**
What the product does, who it serves, and why affiliates should care. Lead with the value
proposition, not the company history.

**Why Promote This Program**
3-5 bullet points covering: commission rate highlights, cookie duration, payment reliability,
product-market fit, conversion-friendly features (free trial, demo, low friction signup).

**Commission Structure**
A markdown table with all commission tiers if multiple exist:

```
| Plan | Price | Commission | Per Sale | Type |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| Starter | $29/mo | 30% | $8.70/mo | Recurring |
| Pro | $89/mo | 30% | $26.70/mo | Recurring |
| Enterprise | Custom | 30% | Varies | Recurring |
```

Include: minimum payout threshold, payment methods (PayPal, wire, etc.), payment frequency
(monthly, net-30, etc.) if found.

**Target Audiences**
Who can promote this product effectively. List 3-5 specific audience types with brief
reasoning, e.g., "YouTube creators making tutorial content — visual product, easy to demo."

**Earning Potential**
Realistic earnings at three traffic levels using conservative conversion assumptions
(2% CTR, 2% conversion rate):

```
| Monthly Traffic | Est. Sales | Monthly Earnings | Annual Earnings |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 5,000 visitors | 2 | $X | $X |
| 20,000 visitors | 8 | $X | $X |
| 100,000 visitors | 40 | $X | $X |
```

For recurring programs, show month-12 compounded earnings, not just month-1.

**Why It Converts**
2-3 sentences on what makes this product easy to sell: free tier, strong brand recognition,
low-commitment entry point, visual demo potential, etc.

**Honest Limitations**
2-3 bullet points on real drawbacks. Every program has them. Examples: short cookie window,
high competition from other affiliates, niche audience only, high price point limits
conversions, payout threshold too high for beginners.

### Step 5: Verify Affiliate Link (If Provided)

If the user provided an affiliate link:
- Check that the domain matches the program's known affiliate tracking domain
- Check for expected URL parameters (ref=, aff=, via=, etc.)
- Flag if the link looks malformed or suspicious
- Do NOT click the link or test it — just validate the format

### Step 6: Assemble Output

Present the output in two clearly separated parts:
1. **Listing Fields** — structured data ready for API submission
2. **Description** — the full markdown content

### Step 7: Optional API Submission

If the user wants to submit the listing directly:

```
POST https://list.affitor.com/api/v1/programs
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>

{
  "name": "...",
  "url": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "reward_type": "...",
  "reward_value": "...",
  "reward_duration": "...",
  "cookie_days": 30,
  "tags": ["...", "..."]
}
```

If no API key is available, format the output so the user can copy-paste it into the
list.affitor.com submission form.

### Step 8: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] `name` matches official product name (exact capitalization)
- [ ] `reward_value` comes from the official affiliate page, not estimated
- [ ] `reward_type` uses one of the allowed enum values
- [ ] `cookie_days` is a number from official source or explicitly marked "unverified"
- [ ] Commission table math is correct (price x percentage = per-sale amount)
- [ ] Earning potential uses conservative assumptions (2% CTR, 2% CR) not optimistic ones
- [ ] Honest Limitations section contains real drawbacks, not filler
- [ ] No data was hallucinated — every number traces to a source

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the
user — just ensure the output passes.

    reward_value: string      # "30%" or "$50"
    reward_duration: string   # "12 months" | "lifetime" | null (for one-time)
    cookie_days: number       # 60
    tags: string[]            # ["ai", "video", "saas"]

## Error Handling

- **Program has no affiliate program:** Tell the user clearly. Suggest checking back later
  or searching for similar programs that do offer affiliates. Do not fabricate commission data.
- **Affiliate page is behind a login wall:** Note that commission details could not be
  verified from public sources. Use network listing or trusted third-party sources as
  fallback. Mark unverified fields explicitly.
- **Data is unclear or conflicting:** When sources disagree (e.g., affiliate page says 20%
  but network says 25%), note both values and flag the discrepancy. Let the user decide
  which to use.
- **Program recently changed terms:** If the affiliate page mentions "updated" or "new"
  commission rates, note the date if available and flag that terms may change.
- **Pricing is usage-based or custom:** Use the most common plan tier for earning
  calculations. Note the assumption. For enterprise-only pricing, use "Contact sales" and
  skip per-sale calculations for that tier.
- **Cookie duration not stated:** Mark as "unverified" and note the network default
  (ShareASale: typically 30d, Impact: varies, PartnerStack: typically 90d). Do not guess.

## Examples

**Example 1: SaaS with recurring commission**
User: "List HeyGen's affiliate program"
- Search official affiliate page → 30% recurring, 60-day cookie, via PartnerStack
- Pricing page → Creator $29/mo, Business $89/mo, Enterprise custom
- Build commission table: Creator = $8.70/mo, Business = $26.70/mo
- Earning potential at 5K visitors: ~2 sales/mo = $17-53/mo (month 1), compounding
- Tags: ai, video, saas, content-creation
- Limitations: competitive niche, product requires learning curve

**Example 2: One-time commission program**
User: "Add Bluehost affiliate program to the list"
- Search → $65+ per signup (one-time), 90-day cookie, direct program
- Pricing → Basic $2.95/mo, Plus $5.45/mo, Choice Plus $5.45/mo
- reward_type: cps_one_time, reward_value: "$65+"
- Earning potential: straightforward per-sale math, no compounding
- Tags: hosting, wordpress, web-hosting, beginner-friendly
- Limitations: saturated market, aggressive competitor affiliates, low-margin hosting

**Example 3: Program with unverifiable data**
User: "Create a listing for this new AI tool I found — ToolXYZ"
- Search affiliate page → behind login, cannot verify commission
- Network listing found on ShareASale → 15% recurring, cookie not specified
- Mark cookie_days as "unverified", note ShareASale default is typically 30 days
- Pricing page → $19/mo and $49/mo plans
- Flag in output: "Commission verified via ShareASale listing. Cookie duration unverified."
- Proceed with listing, clearly marking unverified fields
