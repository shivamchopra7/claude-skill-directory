# Campaign Planner

Designs an influencer campaign from strategy to execution plan — an actionable blueprint that ties business objectives to creative execution.

**Scope edge — product launches**: this skill owns the **creator lane** of a launch. The launch itself — tier/type decision, launch calendar, press motion, community launch day, readiness gate — belongs to the launch discipline ([launch-tier-planner](../../../launch/research/launch-tier-planner/SKILL.md) and siblings), which hands this skill the creator-channel sub-plan aligned to the [launch-registry](../../../protocol/launch-registry/SKILL.md) date and stage. "Launch a product with creators" starts here; "launch a product" starts there.

## Quick Start

```
Create an influencer campaign plan for [product launch]
```

```
Plan an influencer campaign for [brand] with [budget] targeting [audience] during [timeframe]
```

## Skill Contract

- **Reads**: brand and product details, target audience, campaign type, budget, timeline, and any constraints supplied by the user. If `memory-management` is active, prior audience profiles and past-campaign benchmarks load from the hot cache.
- **Writes**: a campaign plan document saved to `memory/influencer/campaign-planner/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
- **Promotes**: durable facts (campaign name, primary objective, total budget, go-live date, KPI targets) to `memory/hot-cache.md`.
- **Done when**:
  - Objectives are SMART and have explicit success and failure definitions.
  - Influencer mix, content deliverables, timeline, budget, and KPIs are each specified with numbers, not placeholders.
  - The plan names the next step (brief generation) and any open approvals.
- **Primary next skill**: [brief-generator](../brief-generator/SKILL.md)

### Handoff Summary

> Emit the standard shape from [skill-contract.md §Handoff Summary Format](../../../references/skill-contract.md).

## Data Sources

This family is Tier 1: every skill works with no live integrations. Provide the brand, audience, budget, and timeline directly and the plan builds from your inputs.

Optional connectors that strengthen the plan when available:

- `~~influencer database` — size the influencer mix and validate tier follower ranges.
- `~~social platform analytics` — set platform-specific reach and engagement benchmarks.
- `~~CRM` — align conversion targets and attribution with existing pipeline data.
- `~~analytics` — pull past-campaign actuals for realistic KPI and budget-efficiency targets.

See [CONNECTORS.md](../../../CONNECTORS.md) for the free/keyless data recipe per category. Without any connector, ask the user for the missing inputs and proceed.

## Instructions

Work the nine steps in order. Each has a fill-in template in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) — copy the matching block, replace every bracket with a real number or value (no placeholders left in the final plan), and assemble in step 9.

1. **Gather campaign requirements** — capture brand, value prop, audience, campaign type, timeline, budget, and constraints (template §1).
2. **Define objectives** — one SMART primary objective plus secondary objectives, with explicit success and failure definitions (template §2).
3. **Develop strategy** — big idea, strategy statement, audience, key messages, campaign pillars, platform split, and differentiation (template §3).
4. **Define influencer criteria** — tier mix, must-have and preferred selection criteria, exclusions, ideal profile, and relationship types. Validate follower ranges against [references/influencer-tiers.md](references/influencer-tiers.md) (template §4).
5. **Plan content requirements** — deliverables by platform/format, required elements, creative direction, themes, and the approval chain (template §5).
6. **Create the timeline** — key dates, a four-phase week-by-week plan, and a Gantt view (template §6).
7. **Allocate budget** — breakdown by category, by influencer tier, by platform, plus CPM/CPE/cost-per-content efficiency targets (template §7).
8. **Establish success metrics** — primary KPIs vs benchmarks, secondary metrics, conversion metrics, and reporting cadence (template §8).
9. **Compile the plan document** — executive summary, the full sections above, and an appendix with risk mitigation (template §9). Save to the Writes path and promote durable facts to the hot cache.

## Example

**User**: "Create a campaign plan for a new sustainable sneaker launch targeting Gen Z on TikTok and Instagram with a $50K budget"

**Output**: A complete plan with sustainability messaging, a micro-influencer-heavy mix, UGC-focused content, a phased launch timeline, and conversion tracking via promo codes. (Fuller walkthrough in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md#worked-example).)
