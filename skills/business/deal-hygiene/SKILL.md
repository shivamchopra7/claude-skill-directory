---

## Purpose

Automated HubSpot deal hygiene maintenance to keep the pipeline clean and accurate.

## Triggers

- "deal hygiene"
- "pipeline cleanup"
- "fix close dates"
- "stale deals"
- "pipeline health check"
- "check pipeline hygiene"

## What It Checks

### 1. Past Close Dates
Deals with close dates in the past get auto-pushed to future based on stage:
- Prospecting: +60 days
- Discovery: +45 days
- Rate Creation: +30 days
- Proposal: +21 days
- Negotiation: +14 days
- Implementation: +14 days
- Shipping: +30 days

### 2. Missing Next Steps
Deals without `hs_next_step` populated (shows as "--" in HubSpot).

### 3. Stale Deals
Deals with no activity for 14+ days (excluding Closed and Shipping stages).

## Usage

### Report Only (Check Mode)
```bash
python scripts/deal_hygiene_check.py
```

### Auto-Fix Close Dates
```bash
python scripts/deal_hygiene_check.py --fix
```

### Custom Stale Threshold
```bash
python scripts/deal_hygiene_check.py --fix --days 30
```

## Integration with Daily Sync

Add to EOD sync for automatic hygiene maintenance:

```python
# In unified_sync.py eod_sync():
subprocess.run(['python', 'scripts/deal_hygiene_check.py', '--fix'])
```
