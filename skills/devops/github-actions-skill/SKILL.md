# GitHub Actions

Expert guidance for building CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

## Quick Start Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e ".[dev]"

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          files: ./coverage.xml
```

## Common Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"  # Daily at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger
  release:
    types: [published]
```

## Matrix Testing

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - run: pytest
```

## Using Secrets

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Workflow Structure

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci.yml           # Test on every push/PR
    ├── cd.yml           # Deploy on release
    ├── docker.yml       # Build and push images
    └── scheduled.yml    # Cron jobs
```
