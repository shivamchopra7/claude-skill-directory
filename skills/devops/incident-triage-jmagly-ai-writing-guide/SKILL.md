# incident-triage

Rapid incident classification, severity assessment, and response coordination.

## Triggers

- "production incident"
- "system is down"
- "critical issue"
- "triage incident"
- "incident severity"
- "outage"
- "P0" / "P1" / "SEV1"

## Purpose

This skill provides rapid incident response coordination by:
- Classifying incident type and severity
- Assembling response team
- Coordinating initial response actions
- Tracking timeline and status
- Facilitating communication
- Preparing post-incident review

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill:

1. **Gathers incident details**:
   - What is happening?
   - When did it start?
   - Who/what is affected?
   - What changed recently?

2. **Classifies severity**:
   - Assess customer impact
   - Determine scope
   - Assign severity level
   - Calculate business impact

3. **Assembles response team**:
   - Identify required responders
   - Notify on-call personnel
   - Establish incident commander

4. **Initiates response**:
   - Create incident channel/bridge
   - Start timeline documentation
   - Coordinate initial diagnosis

5. **Manages communication**:
   - Internal status updates
   - Customer communication (if needed)
   - Executive notifications (for high severity)

6. **Tracks resolution**:
   - Document actions taken
   - Track mitigation progress
   - Confirm resolution
   - Schedule post-incident review

## Incident Commander

**Name**: Sarah Chen
**Role**: Senior SRE

## Response Team

| Role | Name | Joined |
|------|------|--------|
| Incident Commander | Sarah Chen | 14:38 |
| Backend Lead | David Kim | 14:40 |
| DBA | Elena Rodriguez | 14:45 |
| Comms Lead | James Wilson | 14:50 |

## Impact Assessment

### Customer Impact
- **Scope**: All customers using web and mobile apps
- **Severity**: Complete service outage
- **Duration**: 1h 15m
- **Affected Features**: All authenticated features

### Business Impact
- **Revenue Loss**: Estimated $XX,XXX
- **SLA Breach**: Yes (99.9% monthly target affected)
- **Customer Complaints**: 127 support tickets

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 14:32 | First customer reports of errors |
| 14:35 | PagerDuty alert for 5xx spike |
| 14:38 | Incident declared, Sarah Chen IC |
| 14:40 | Investigation begins |
| 14:45 | Identified: DB connection pool exhausted |
| 14:52 | Root cause: Runaway query from batch job |
| 15:00 | Mitigation: Batch job killed |
| 15:10 | Connection pool recovering |
| 15:30 | 50% traffic restored |
| 15:47 | Full service restored |
| 15:50 | Monitoring confirms stable |
| 16:00 | Incident closed |

## Root Cause

**Summary**: A scheduled batch job contained an inefficient query that held database connections indefinitely, exhausting the connection pool.

**Details**:
- Batch job deployed at 14:00 with new query
- Query had missing index, causing full table scan
- Each scan held connection for 30+ seconds
- 100 concurrent requests × 30s = pool exhausted
- New requests could not get connections → 5xx errors

**Contributing Factors**:
1. Missing index migration in batch job deploy
2. No query timeout configured
3. Connection pool size not tuned for load
4. Batch job ran during peak hours

## Resolution

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Killed runaway batch job
2. Restarted application servers to reset connections
3. Verified service restoration

**Permanent Fixes** (follow-ups):
- [ ] Add missing index (INC-001-01)
- [ ] Configure query timeouts (INC-001-02)
- [ ] Increase connection pool size (INC-001-03)
- [ ] Move batch jobs to off-peak hours (INC-001-04)
- [ ] Add connection pool monitoring alerts (INC-001-05)

## Communication Log

## Usage Examples

### Declare Incident

```
User: "Production is down, API returning 500 errors"

Skill initiates:
1. Gather details
2. Classify severity
3. Create incident record
4. Notify responders

Output:
"🚨 INCIDENT DECLARED: INC-2025-001234

Severity: SEV1 (Critical) - Complete API failure
Impact: All customers affected

Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Incident record created
2. ✅ Paging on-call: Sarah Chen (SRE)
3. ✅ Slack channel: #incident-2025-001234
4. ⏳ Assembling response team

You are Incident Commander until relieved.

Quick Checklist:
- [ ] What changed in last 2 hours?
- [ ] Check: logs, metrics, recent deploys
- [ ] Status page update needed?

Update command: 'incident update <message>'"
```

### Severity Assessment

```
User: "Is this SEV1 or SEV2? Users can't checkout but browsing works"

Skill evaluates:
- Core function affected: Yes (checkout = revenue)
- Workaround: No (can't complete purchase)
- Customer %: All attempting checkout
- Revenue impact: Direct

Output:
"Severity Assessment: SEV1 (Critical)

Rationale:
✓ Revenue-impacting feature down
✓ No workaround for affected flow
✓ Checkout is business-critical path
✓ Affects all customers attempting purchase

SEV1 Criteria Met:
- Complete feature outage: checkout
- Revenue impact: direct
- No workaround: cannot complete purchases

Response Requirements:
- 15-minute update cadence
- Executive notification: immediate
- Customer communication: within 30 minutes
- Target resolution: 4 hours"
```

### Status Update

```
User: "Incident update: found the issue, deploying fix"

Skill logs:
1. Add to timeline
2. Update status
3. Notify stakeholders

Output:
"Incident Update: INC-2025-001234

Status: Mitigating
Time: 15:15 UTC

Update Logged:
'Found root cause, deploying fix'

Next Actions:
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Notify executive stakeholders
- [ ] Continue timeline documentation

Time Since Start: 43 minutes
Next Update Due: 15:30 UTC"
