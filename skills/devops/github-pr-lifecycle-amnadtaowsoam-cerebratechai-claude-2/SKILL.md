## PR Creation Workflow

### Branch Naming Conventions

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication

```

### Creating a Pull Request

  --base main \
  --head feature/user-auth \
  --label enhancement \
  --reviewer @tech-lead \
  --assignee @me

# Using Git
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
git push origin feature/user-auth

## Merge Strategies

### Merge Types

| Strategy | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Merge Commit** | Creates merge commit | Preserve history |
| **Squash and Merge** | Combines all commits | Clean history |
| **Rebase and Merge** | Replays commits on target | Linear history |
| **Fast-forward** | Moves pointer forward | No merge commit |

### Merge Best Practices

```bash
# Squash merge for clean history
gh pr merge 123 --squash --delete-branch

# Rebase merge for linear history
gh pr merge 123 --rebase --delete-branch

# Create merge commit
gh pr merge 123 --merge --delete-branch

# Merge with custom commit message
gh pr merge 123 --squash \
  --subject "feat: Add user authentication" \
  --body "Implements #123. Adds JWT-based authentication."
```

### Branch Protection Rules

```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml (via GitHub UI)
# Main branch protection settings:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require approval from CODEOWNERS
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Restrict who can push to matching branches
- Allow force pushes
- Include administrators
```

## Post-Merge Activities

### Branch Cleanup

```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/user-auth

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/user-auth

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh repo sync --delete-source-branches
```

### Issue Management

```bash
# Close related issue when PR merges
gh issue close 123 --comment "Fixed by #456"

# Add comment to issue
gh issue comment 123 --body "Merged in #456. Will be available in next release."

# Link PR to issue (in PR description)
Closes #123

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Large PRs** - Keep PRs small and focused for easier review
2. **Poor descriptions** - Always provide clear context and testing notes
3. **Not self-reviewing** - Review your own code before requesting others
4. **Ignoring conflicts** - Resolve merge conflicts promptly
5. **Forcing merges** - Wait for all approvals and checks
6. **Not cleaning branches** - Delete merged branches to keep repo clean
7. **Missing context** - Link related issues and provide background
8. **Breaking changes without notice** - Always document breaking changes
