# ICT MNQ Trading System for MFFU Evaluation

## Account Parameters (FIXED)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Account Size | $50,000 |
| Daily Loss Limit | $2,500 |
| Contracts | 5 MNQ |
| Point Value | $2/point per contract ($10 total) |
| Max SL per trade | 25 points ($250) |
| Target per trade | 30-50 points ($300-$500) |
| Max trades per day | 3-4 (to preserve daily limit) |
| Profit target for eval | $3,000 |

## Risk Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

1. **Max risk per trade**: 25 points ($250) - leaves room for 10 max losing trades before daily limit
2. **If down $1,500 in a day**: STOP TRADING - reassess next session
3. **No revenge trading**: Wait minimum 30 minutes after a loss
4. **No trading during high-impact news**: Within 15 min before/after

## Analysis Workflow

When user provides setup data, follow this exact sequence:

### Step 0: Check for MMXM Structure
Read `references/mmxm-models.md` for Market Maker Model framework.

MMXM provides highest probability setups when all 5 phases are visible:
1. Original Consolidation
2. Engineering Liquidity (price run)
3. Smart Money Reversal (entry zone)
4. Accumulation/Distribution
5. Completion (target)

If MMXM structure is clear, prioritize it over standard setups.

### Step 1: Determine HTF Bias
Read `references/bias-determination.md` for detailed rules.

Quick check:
- Daily/4H structure: Higher highs/lows = BULLISH, Lower highs/lows = BEARISH
- Previous day candle: Bullish close above 50% = BULLISH bias
- Week structure: Where is price relative to PWH/PWL?

### Step 2: Identify Session Context
Read `references/session-times.md` for kill zone windows.

- **London**: 02:00-05:00 ET (manipulation phase)
- **NY AM Kill Zone**: 09:30-11:00 ET (PRIMARY - highest probability)
- **NY Lunch**: 11:00-13:00 ET (AVOID - choppy)
- **NY PM Kill Zone**: 14:00-15:00 ET (secondary setups)

### Step 3: Check for Valid Setup
Read `references/ict-setups.md` for detailed setup criteria.
Read `references/mmxm-models.md` for MMXM framework.

Valid setups (in order of priority):
1. **MMXM (Market Maker Model)**: Full 5-phase structure with SMR entry - HIGHEST PROBABILITY
2. **Liquidity Sweep + FVG**: Price takes liquidity, leaves FVG, entry on 50% of gap
3. **Order Block + MSS**: Market structure shift into valid OB
4. **Silver Bullet**: 10:00-11:00 or 14:00-15:00 FVG entries
5. **OTE**: 62-79% fib retracement in discount/premium

### Step 4: Calculate Entry, SL, TP

For MMXM MMBM (Long) setups:
- Confirm: Original Consolidation → Engineering (lower highs) → SMR zone reached
- Entry: 50% of FVG formed AFTER MSS/CHoCH
- SL: Below swept liquidity / SMR low (max 25 points)
- TP1: Old highs from Engineering Liquidity phase
- TP2: Original Consolidation high or HTF DOL

For MMXM MMSM (Short) setups:
- Confirm: Original Consolidation → Engineering (higher lows) → SMR zone reached
- Entry: 50% of FVG formed AFTER MSS/CHoCH
- SL: Above swept liquidity / SMR high (max 25 points)
- TP1: Old lows from Engineering Liquidity phase
- TP2: Original Consolidation low or HTF DOL

For standard LONG setups:
- Entry: 50% of bullish FVG or top of bullish OB
- SL: Below FVG/OB low OR below liquidity sweep low (max 25 points)
- TP1: Nearest sell-side liquidity (equal highs, PDH, session high)
- TP2: HTF draw on liquidity

For standard SHORT setups:
- Entry: 50% of bearish FVG or bottom of bearish OB
- SL: Above FVG/OB high OR above liquidity sweep high (max 25 points)
- TP1: Nearest buy-side liquidity (equal lows, PDL, session low)
- TP2: HTF draw on liquidity

### Step 5: Provide Verdict
