## Decision Rules Summary

### BEFORE Research
- IF company already in HubSpot → UPDATE existing record, don't create duplicate
- IF target is B2B/wholesale only → SKIP (not DTC fit)
- IF no website found → SKIP (insufficient data)

### DURING Research
- IF shipping page not found → CHECK checkout flow AND FAQ AND search "[BRAND] shipping policy"
- IF no contacts on website → TRY LinkedIn "See all employees" AND press releases
- IF Chrome DevTools timeout → FALLBACK to WebSearch AND Wayback Machine
- IF revenue unknown → ESTIMATE from (funding ÷ 10) OR (employees × $200K)

### AFTER Research
- IF confidence < 60% → DO NOT SUBMIT (LOW quality)
- IF confidence 60-79% → FLAG for manual review (MEDIUM)
- IF confidence 80%+ → READY for HubSpot creation (HIGH)
- IF contacts < 2 verified → CONTINUE research until 2+ found

### HubSpot Integration
- ALWAYS search by email AND domain BEFORE creating records
- ALWAYS use exact industry values (CONSUMER_GOODS not "consumer goods")
- ALWAYS set hubspot_owner_id = "699257003"
- ALWAYS create Company THEN Contact(s) THEN Associate

## Shipping Validation Quality Gate (v3.8)

**MANDATORY**: Every Brand Scout report MUST validate 5 shipping criteria before completion.

### 5-Point Checklist

| # | Criterion | Required Value | Confidence Marker |
|---|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Shipping Page URL | Exact URL or "Not found" | Confirmed/Not found |
| 2 | Free Shipping Threshold | $X+ or "No free shipping" | Confirmed/Inferred/Not found |
| 3 | Standard Delivery Window | X-Y business days | Confirmed/Inferred/Not found |
| 4 | Carrier/Fulfillment Info | Names or "Not disclosed" | Confirmed/Inferred/Not found |
| 5 | Expedited Options | Service names or "Not offered" | Confirmed/Inferred/Not found |

### Research Sequence (try in order)

1. `/shipping` or `/pages/shipping`
2. `/policies/shipping-policy` (Shopify standard)
3. `/shipping-returns` or `/delivery`
4. `/faq` (search for shipping section)
5. `/help` or help center subdomain
6. **Return Policy Page** - Often reveals 3PL/warehouse address
7. **FALLBACK**: Coupon sites (Knoji, SimplyCodes) for free threshold

### Validation Rules

- Report is **INCOMPLETE** until all 5 criteria have explicit values
- "Not found" is a valid value (means data is unavailable, not missing research)
- Every report MUST include `## SHIPPING VALIDATION STATUS` table
- Score of 5/5 required for report completion

## Report Structure (9 Sections)

1. **Snapshot** - Revenue, AOV, annual volume, growth rate
2. **Shipping Intelligence** - Carriers, service levels, SLA, complaints, 3PL
3. **Company Overview** - Legal name, HQ, founding, DTC/wholesale split
4. **Stakeholders & Contacts** - Decision makers with verified emails/LinkedIn
5. **Observations & Competitors** - Strengths, complaints %, benchmarks, risks
6. **HubSpot Lead Record** - Copy/paste fields ready for import
7. **CRM Contact Summary** - One-line format for quick reference
8. **Technical Integration** - Platform, APIs, monitoring capabilities
9. **Methodology & Versioning** - Sources, tools, confidence score

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Score | Criteria | Action |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| HIGH | 80%+ | 2+ sources, verified contacts, shipping confirmed | Ready for HubSpot |
| MEDIUM | 60-79% | Single source, some estimates | Manual review needed |
| LOW | <60% | Multiple blanks, no verified contacts | DO NOT SUBMIT |
