## Metadata
- skill_name: phase2-discovery
- activation_code: PHASE2_DISCOVERY_V1
- version: 1.0.0
- category: discovery
- phase: 2

## Description

Interactive project discovery orchestrator. Guides users through artifact collection, scope definition, and PRD generation through a conversational seven-stage process.

## Activation Criteria

- User says "begin project discovery", "start discovery", or "discover"
- User opens a project with `.discovery/discovery-state.json` showing incomplete status
- User says "resume discovery"
- Before any Phase 3+ work when no PRD exists

## Discovery Modes

### Quick Mode (Express Discovery)

For users who already know what they want to build. Uses rapid yes/no questions instead of deep exploration.

**Activation:** "quick discovery", "express discovery", "fast PRD"

```
QUICK DISCOVERY MODE

I'll ask rapid-fire questions. Answer with:
  • Y/N for yes/no
  • Skip to use defaults
  • Expand to dive deeper on any topic

Ready? Let's go...
```

**Quick Mode Flow:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Time:** 5-10 minutes (vs 45-120 for full discovery)

### Component Mode

For building components that integrate into a larger system. Skips deployment and certain operational phases.

**Activation:** "component mode", "library mode", "building a component"

**What's different:**
- Skips Phase 8 (Deployment) - deployment happens at system level
- Skips E2E user workflows - tested at integration level
- Focuses on interface contracts and API design
- Emphasizes testability and documentation

**Pipeline ends at:** Phase 6 (Integration Testing) or Phase 7 (if E2E included)

```json
{
  "pipeline_config": {
    "mode": "component",
    "skip_phases": [8, 8.5],
    "optional_phases": [7],
    "focus_areas": ["interface_contracts", "unit_tests", "documentation"],
    "deployment_venue": "external",
    "e2e_venue": "integration_repo"
  }
}
```

### Full Mode (Default)

Complete 9-stage discovery with deep exploration of each area. Best for:
- Greenfield projects
- Complex systems
- When you're not sure what to build

## Web Research Integration

This skill integrates with the **Web Researcher** skill for structured external research using Claude Code's built-in WebSearch and WebFetch tools.

### Research Prompt

**At the start of discovery, offer research:**
```
Before we dive in, would you like me to research the landscape?

I can look up:
  • Competitors - pricing, features, differentiators
  • Technical patterns - how others solve similar problems
  • Market data - size, trends, opportunities

This helps inform our decisions but won't drive requirements.
Your vision stays primary.

Say "research competitors" or "skip research" to continue.
```

### When to Offer Research

| Stage | Offer | Trigger Phrase |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Start of discovery | Competitor/market research | "research competitors" |
| Stage 2.1 (Artifacts) | Similar projects | "find similar projects" |
| Stage 2.2.5 (Users) | User behavior patterns | "research user patterns" |
| Stage 2.3 (Scope) | Feature benchmarks | "what features do others have" |
| Stage 2.4 (I/O) | API documentation | "fetch API docs for [service]" |
| Stage 2.5 (Constraints) | Industry benchmarks | "research benchmarks" |

### Research Output Integration

Web research results are saved to `.research/` and can feed into PRD:
- **Section 3 (Market Context)**: Competitor landscape, market size
- **Section 5 (Anti-Requirements)**: "Unlike X, we won't..."
- **Section 8 (Architecture)**: Technical pattern recommendations

**Note:** Research-sourced additions get -0.15 confidence penalty with Plan Guardian.

## Internet-Enabled Discovery

This skill has **full internet access**. Leverage this throughout the discovery process:

### Available Research Capabilities

| Capability | When to Use | Tools |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Web Search** | Research competitors, similar projects, best practices | WebSearch, WebFetch |
| **API Documentation** | Fetch specs for integrations the user mentions | WebFetch |
| **GitHub Research** | Analyze similar open-source projects, find patterns | GitHub MCP tools |
| **Technical Standards** | Look up compliance requirements, protocols, formats | WebSearch, WebFetch |
| **Library/Framework Docs** | Research technology choices | WebFetch |
| **Competitive Analysis** | Understand market landscape | WebSearch |
| **Web Researcher** | Structured multi-source research | Web Researcher skill |

### Proactive Research Opportunities

During discovery, **proactively offer to research**:

1. **Stage 0.1 (Artifacts)**: "Would you like me to find similar open-source projects or competitor products for reference?"

2. **Stage 0.2 (Context)**: "I can research common architectural patterns for [project type]. Want me to look that up?"

3. **Stage 0.3 (Scope)**: "Should I check what features similar products typically include?"

4. **Stage 0.4 (I/O)**: "I can fetch the API documentation for [mentioned service]. Would that help?"

5. **Stage 0.5 (Constraints)**: "Want me to look up industry benchmarks for [performance/security] requirements?"

6. **Stage 0.6 (Requirements)**: "I can research how similar systems handle [specific functionality]. Interested?"

### Research Output

When conducting research, save findings to `.discovery/artifacts/research/`:
- `competitors.md` — Competitive analysis
- `api-specs/` — Downloaded API documentation
- `best-practices.md` — Industry best practices
- `benchmarks.md` — Performance/security benchmarks
- `technology-options.md` — Technology comparison notes

## Discovery State

Track progress in `.discovery/discovery-state.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "current_stage": "0.1",
  "stages": {

  "project_type": null,
  "layer_assignment": null,
  "personas": [],
  "software_potential": null,
  "mvp_scope": null
}
```

## Starting Discovery

When user initiates discovery:

1. **Check for existing state**
   - If `.discovery/discovery-state.json` exists and is incomplete, offer to resume
   - Otherwise, create fresh discovery state

2. **Create directory structure**
```
.discovery/
├── artifacts/
│   ├── existing-prds/
│   ├── architecture/
│   ├── interfaces/
│   ├── existing-code/
│   ├── compliance/
│   └── research/
├── scope/
├── discovery-state.json
└── discovery-log.md
```

3. **Display welcome message**
```
PHASE 2: PROJECT DISCOVERY

I'll guide you through defining your project requirements. We'll cover:

  Stage 2.1:   Artifact Collection     (gather context + web research)
  Stage 2.2:   Project Context         (understand positioning)
  Stage 2.2.5: User Discovery          (personas, journeys, pain points) ← NEW
  Stage 2.3:   Scope Bounding          (define boundaries + software potential) ← ENHANCED
  Stage 2.4:   Input/Output Definition (specify interfaces + fetch API docs)
  Stage 2.5:   Constraint Elicitation  (non-negotiables + benchmarks)
  Stage 2.6:   Requirements Discovery  (define what system does)
  Stage 2.7:   PRD Synthesis           (generate your PRD)
  Stage 2.8:   Strategic Alignment     (business validation + MVP scope) ← NEW

I have full internet access — I can research competitors, fetch API
docs, look up benchmarks, and analyze similar projects as we go.

This process ensures we're building the RIGHT thing (Stages 2.1-2.8)
before we build it RIGHT (Phases 3-12).

Time estimate: 45-120 minutes

You can pause anytime and resume later.

Ready to begin? Let's start with Stage 2.1: Artifact Collection.
```

## Stage 2.1: Artifact Collection

**Goal:** Gather existing materials that provide context — both local files AND web resources.

**Questions to ask:**

1. "Do you have any existing materials to share that would help me understand your project?"

2. Present categories for **local artifacts**:
   - Parent or related PRDs (if part of larger system)
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Interface specifications (APIs, protocols)
   - Existing codebase (if improving existing code)
   - Compliance/regulatory documents
   - Research papers or whitepapers
   - Meeting notes or decision records

3. **Offer web-based research:**
   - "Would you like me to research similar projects or competitors online?"
   - "Are there any APIs or services you plan to integrate with? I can fetch their documentation."
   - "Should I look up any technical standards or compliance frameworks relevant to your project?"

4. For each artifact provided:
   - Copy to appropriate `.discovery/artifacts/` subdirectory
   - Analyze and extract key information
   - Summarize findings to user

5. For web research conducted:
   - Save to `.discovery/artifacts/research/`
   - Summarize key findings
   - Note sources for traceability

6. If user says "none" or "skip":
   - Acknowledge greenfield project
   - Still offer: "Even without local artifacts, I can research similar projects online. Interested?"

**Web Research Actions:**

| User Mentions | Research Action |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Competitor name | Search for their product, features, pricing |
| API integration | Fetch API docs, OpenAPI specs if available |
| Technology stack | Research best practices, common patterns |
| Industry/domain | Look up domain-specific requirements, standards |
| Similar product | Find open-source alternatives on GitHub |

**Completion criteria:**
- User confirms all artifacts collected
- Web research completed (if requested)
- Summary of all artifacts displayed
- State updated with `artifacts_collected` list

## Stage 2.2: Project Context

**Goal:** Understand project type and positioning.

**Questions to ask:**

1. "What type of project is this?"
   - Greenfield (new from scratch)
   - Brownfield (improving existing code)
   - Replacement (rewriting legacy system)
   - Integration (connecting existing systems)

2. If brownfield/replacement: "What's being kept vs. replaced?"

3. "Where does this fit architecturally?" (Explain L0-L5 layers)
   - L0: Primitives (math, types, no dependencies)
   - L1: Infrastructure (logging, config, networking)
   - L2: Spatial (coordinates, transforms)
   - L3: Processing (algorithms, data processing)
   - L4: Fusion (multi-source integration)
   - L5: Interface (APIs, user-facing)

4. "What systems does this depend on?" (upstream)

5. "What systems depend on this?" (downstream)

**If artifacts include parent PRD:**
- Extract positioning information automatically
- Confirm with user

**Completion criteria:**
- Project type determined
- Layer assignment confirmed
- Dependencies documented

## Stage 2.2.5: User Discovery (NEW)

**Goal:** Understand who will use this and why, before defining scope.

**Why this matters:** Scope decisions should be driven by user needs, not technical convenience. This stage ensures we build the right thing for the right people.

### Step 1: Identify User Types

Ask: "Who are the different types of people who will use this system?"

For each user type, capture:
- Role/title
- Primary goal with the system
- Technical sophistication level
- Frequency of use

### Step 2: Create Primary Persona

**Template:**
```
Persona: [Name]
Role: [Job title/role]
Goals:
  - [Primary goal]
  - [Secondary goal]
Pain Points:
  - [Current frustration 1]
  - [Current frustration 2]
Context: [When/where/how they'd use this]
Quote: "[Something this persona might say about the problem]"
```

**Proactive Research:**
- "Want me to research user behavior patterns for [this type of user]?"
- "I can look up UX best practices for [industry/domain]. Interested?"

### Step 3: Map User Journey

For the primary persona, map their journey:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Awareness  │────▶│   First Use │────▶│  Regular Use│────▶│   Advocacy  │
│  How they   │     │  Onboarding │     │  Core value │     │  Sharing    │
│  find us    │     │  experience │     │  delivery   │     │  with others│
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

Ask at each stage:
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What emotions are they feeling?
- What could go wrong?

### Step 4: Identify Pain Points

Ask: "What's frustrating about how users solve this problem today?"

Categories:
- Time wasters
- Error-prone steps
- Missing information
- Context switching
- Waiting/delays

### Step 5: Define Value Proposition

Help user articulate:
- Core benefit (primary value)
- Unique differentiator (why choose this)
- Proof points (how we demonstrate value)

**Generate:** `.discovery/scope/personas.yaml`, `.discovery/scope/user-journey.md`

**Completion criteria:**
- At least one primary persona defined
- User journey mapped for primary persona
- Top 3 pain points identified
- Value proposition articulated

## Stage 2.3: Scope Bounding

**Goal:** Explicitly define what's IN and OUT of scope.

**Ask about each component category:**

| Component | Response Options |
|-----------|------------------|
| Backend/Core Processing | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| Frontend/UI | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| Mobile Applications | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| Database/Persistence | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| External API (public) | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| Internal API (service) | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| Authentication/Auth | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| Monitoring/Observability | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |
| Deployment/Infrastructure | In scope / Out of scope / N/A |

**Generate:** `.discovery/scope/boundaries.yaml`

### Software Potential Checklist (NEW)

After defining basic scope, explore future potential dimensions:

**Ask:** "Let's think about what this could become. For each dimension, tell me if it's relevant now, might be relevant later, or not applicable."

```yaml
software_potential:
  # API & Extensibility
  api_extensibility:
    public_api: [In v1 / Future / Never / TBD]
    webhook_support: [In v1 / Future / Never / TBD]
    developer_sdk: [In v1 / Future / Never / TBD]

    freemium: [In v1 / Future / Never / TBD]
    enterprise_licensing: [In v1 / Future / Never / TBD]
    marketplace_revenue: [In v1 / Future / Never / TBD]
```

**Why this matters:** Decisions made now affect future potential. Understanding future possibilities helps make better architectural choices today.

**Proactive Research:**
- "I can research how similar products evolved over time. Want me to look that up?"
- "Should I find examples of successful platform/ecosystem plays in this space?"

**Generate:** `.discovery/scope/software-potential.yaml`

**Completion criteria:**
- All categories addressed
- User confirms scope summary
- boundaries.yaml created
- software-potential.yaml created

## Stage 2.4: Input/Output Definition

**Goal:** Precisely define system interfaces.

**For INPUTS, ask:**
- What data/requests does the system receive?
- Where does each input come from?
- What format (JSON, protobuf, binary, etc.)?
- What rate/frequency?

**For OUTPUTS, ask:**
- What data/responses does the system produce?
- Who/what consumes each output?
- What format?
- What rate/frequency?

**Don't forget:**
- Configuration inputs
- Metrics outputs
- Log outputs
- Event outputs

**Web Research for Interfaces:**

When user mentions an external service or API:
1. **Offer to fetch documentation**: "I can pull the API docs for [service]. Want me to?"
2. **Look up OpenAPI/Swagger specs** if available
3. **Research common integration patterns** for that service
4. **Save specs** to `.discovery/artifacts/api-specs/`

| Service Type | Research Action |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) | Fetch relevant service API docs |
| SaaS integration (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) | Get API reference, rate limits, auth patterns |
| Database | Look up connection patterns, query formats |
| Message queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) | Research message formats, consumer patterns |
| OAuth/Auth provider | Fetch token formats, flow documentation |

**Generate:** `.discovery/scope/inputs.yaml`, `.discovery/scope/outputs.yaml`

**Completion criteria:**
- All inputs documented with source, format, rate
- All outputs documented with consumer, format, rate
- External API specs fetched (if applicable)
- User confirms I/O summary

## Stage 2.5: Constraint Elicitation

**Goal:** Document non-negotiable requirements.

**Walk through four categories:**

### Performance Constraints
- Latency requirements (target, max, P99)
- Throughput requirements
- Memory limits
- CPU/GPU requirements
- Startup time

### Security Constraints
- Network model (traditional, zero trust, air-gapped)
- Authentication requirements
- Data classification
- Compliance frameworks
- Encryption requirements

### Reliability Constraints
- Availability target
- Failure mode (fail-fast, fail-safe, graceful)
- Recovery time objective
- Redundancy requirements

### Compliance Constraints
- Industry standards
- Regulatory requirements
- Audit requirements

**Web Research for Constraints:**

When user is uncertain, **proactively research benchmarks**:

| Constraint Type | Research Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Latency targets | Search for industry benchmarks (e.g., "e-commerce API latency benchmarks") |
| Availability | Look up SLA standards for similar services |
| Compliance | Fetch framework requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR) |
| Security standards | Research OWASP, NIST, CIS benchmarks |
| Performance | Find case studies from similar-scale systems |

**Offer research when user says "I don't know":**
- "I can look up typical [latency/availability/etc.] requirements for [industry/project type]. Want me to?"
- "Should I research what [compliance framework] specifically requires?"
- "I can find benchmarks from similar projects. Interested?"

**Save research to:** `.discovery/artifacts/research/benchmarks.md`

**For any "I don't know" responses:**
- Offer to research benchmarks
- Suggest reasonable defaults based on research
- Mark as "TBD" if user prefers

**Generate:** `.discovery/scope/constraints.yaml`

**Completion criteria:**
- All constraint categories addressed
- Benchmarks researched (if requested)
- User confirms constraints summary
- constraints.yaml created

## Stage 2.6: Requirements Discovery

**Goal:** Define functional requirements in EARS format.

**EARS Format:**
```
WHEN [trigger condition], the system SHALL [required behavior].
```

**Process:**
1. Start with core functionality based on project description
2. Propose requirements from artifacts (if any)
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. For each requirement:
   - State in EARS format
   - Assign ID (R_XXX)
   - Ask user to Accept / Modify / Reject

**Requirement categories to cover:**
- Core functionality
- Error handling
- Performance (derived from constraints)
- Security (derived from constraints)
- Observability
- Integration points

**Completion criteria:**
- All major functional areas covered
- Each requirement in EARS format with ID

1. Architectural Layer Assignment
2. Dependency Declaration
3. Interface Contract Summary
4. Executive Summary
5. System Architecture
6. Feature Requirements (from Stage 0.6) + Anti-Requirements
7. Non-Functional Requirements (from Stage 0.5)
8. Code Structure
9. TDD Implementation Guide
10. Integration Testing
11. Documentation Requirements
12. Operational Readiness
13. Compliance & Audit
14. Migration & Rollback
15. Risk & Assumptions
16. Success Metrics
17. Task Decomposition Guidance
18. Future Potential & Evolution (from Stage 0.3 software potential)
Appendices A-E

**Present to user:**
```
DISCOVERY COMPLETE

PRD generated at: docs/PRD.md

Summary:
  - Requirements: [count]
  - Project Type: [type]
  - Layer: [L0-L5]
  - Dependencies: [count] upstream, [count] downstream

Next steps:
  1. Review the PRD
  2. Make any edits directly
  3. Say "PRD approved, begin automated development" to proceed
```

**Completion criteria:**
- PRD generated at docs/PRD.md
- User has reviewed initial draft

## Stage 2.8: Strategic Alignment (NEW)

**Goal:** Validate the PRD against business objectives before proceeding to execution.

**Why this matters:** Technical requirements should serve business goals. This gate ensures we're building the right thing before we build it right.

### Step 1: Business Model Validation

Ask: "How does this software create and capture value?"

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Who pays? | [Customer / Advertiser / Enterprise / N/A] |
| How do they pay? | [Subscription / Usage / One-time / Free] |
| What's the unit economics? | [Cost to serve vs. revenue per user] |
| What's the growth model? | [Viral / Sales / Content / Product-led] |

### Step 2: Stakeholder Alignment

Ask: "Who needs to approve or be informed about this project?"

| Stakeholder | Interest | Influence | Status |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| [Name/Role] | [Their goals] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Approve/Inform/Consult] |

### Step 3: MVP Definition

Ask: "What's the smallest version that delivers value?"

```
MUST HAVE (MVP):
- [Feature 1] - Required for core value
- [Feature 2] - Required for core value

SHOULD HAVE (v1.1):
- [Feature 3] - Important but not critical
- [Feature 4] - Enhances experience

COULD HAVE (v2.0):
- [Feature 5] - Nice to have
- [Feature 6] - Future expansion

WON'T HAVE (This version):
- [Feature 7] - Out of scope
- [Feature 8] - Technical debt we accept
```

### Step 4: Success Criteria Review

Review success metrics from PRD Section 0.5:

| Metric | Target | Realistic? | Measurable? | Aligned with Business? |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [Y/N] | [Y/N] | [Y/N] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target] | [Y/N] | [Y/N] | [Y/N] |

### Step 5: Risk Acknowledgment

Review top risks from discovery:

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Accepted? |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] | [Y/N] |
| [Risk 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] | [Y/N] |

### Step 6: Final Approval

**Generate:** `.discovery/strategic-alignment.yaml`

**Completion criteria:**
- Business model validated
- Stakeholders identified
- MVP scope confirmed
- Success criteria reviewed
- Risks acknowledged
- User gives final approval

## Commands

Handle these commands during discovery:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `discovery status` | Show current stage and progress |
| `discovery pause` | Save state and pause |
| `discovery resume` | Resume from saved state |
| `discovery restart` | Start over (keeps artifacts) |
| `skip` | Skip current question |
| `back` | Return to previous question |
| `help` | Show help for current stage |
| `example` | Show example for current question |

## Transition to Phase 3

When user approves PRD:
1. Update discovery state to complete
2. Create `.claude/.signals/phase2-complete.json`
3. Transition to Phase 3 (PRD Validation)

## Error Recovery

If user seems stuck:
- Offer to show an example
- Offer to skip and return later
- Suggest breaking down the question

If artifacts fail to load:
- Log error
- Continue without that artifact
- Note gap in discovery-log.md
