# monitor-contacts

Always-on contact freshness monitoring service. Runs on a schedule (via
`/scheduler`) to keep contact profiles current, detect significant changes
(job moves, company news, acquisitions), and alert via Discord.

## Why This Exists

Contact enrichment is a point-in-time snapshot. People change jobs. Companies
get acquired. Programs end. This service ensures your contact intelligence
stays fresh without manual re-research.

## Continuous Operation (Non-Negotiable)

This skill is **always-on**. It:
- Runs on its configured schedule indefinitely — it NEVER stops unless explicitly halted by the user
- The agent MUST NOT stop and wait for the human to ask for status or remember to check
- If a cycle fails, diagnose the failure, attempt auto-repair, and continue
- Only escalate to the human if genuinely blocked after exhausting /dogpile research
- Gracefully handles restarts and maintains state across cycles
- Is designed for multi-day/week/month autonomous operation

**Anti-pattern**: Reporting status and waiting for the human to ask "what next?" is UNACCEPTABLE. The agent must proactively fix issues and continue the monitoring loop.

## Commands

```bash
# Start monitoring (foreground)
./run.sh monitor

# Start as background service
./run.sh start

# Stop background service
./run.sh stop

# Check service status
./run.sh status

# Run one monitoring cycle manually
./run.sh cycle

# Show contact freshness report
./run.sh report

# Show recent changes
./run.sh changes --since 7d

# Configure monitoring
./run.sh config --interval weekly --budget 10 --alert-channel contacts
```

## Monitoring Cycle

Each cycle:

```
1. SCAN — Find contacts with staleness > threshold
   ├── Default threshold: 30 days
   ├── High-priority contacts: 14 days
   └── Low-priority contacts: 90 days

2. PRIORITIZE — Sort by staleness + importance
   ├── Contacts with upcoming meetings/events → top
   ├── Contacts in active deals/programs → high
   └── Cold contacts → low

3. RESEARCH — Re-enrich top N stale contacts
   ├── Uses /discover-contacts research pipeline
   ├── Budget-limited (default: 10 contacts per cycle)
   └── Rate-limited to avoid API exhaustion

4. DIFF — Compare new profile vs stored profile
   ├── Job title changed?
   ├── Company changed?
   ├── New publications?
   ├── Company news (funding, acquisition)?
   └── Email likely stale?

5. ALERT — Notify on significant changes
   ├── Discord embed with change summary
   ├── Color-coded: green (positive), yellow (neutral), red (attention)
   └── Weekly digest option
```

## Change Detection

The change detector tracks these signals:

| Signal | Severity | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Job change** | High | "John Rushby moved from SRI to DARPA" |
| **Company acquisition** | High | "Galois acquired by [company]" |
| **New DARPA program** | Medium | "Contact's company awarded new DARPA contract" |
| **New publication** | Low | "3 new papers on ArXiv" |
| **Email bounce** | Medium | "Email domain changed" |
| **Company funding** | Medium | "Series B announced" |
| **Company layoffs** | High | "Major restructuring reported" |
| **Conference appearance** | Low | "Speaking at [event]" |

## Discord Alerts

### Individual Change Alert
```
Contact Change Detected
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

John Rushby
  Was: Senior Computer Scientist @ SRI International
  Now: Program Manager @ DARPA I2O

  Change Type: Job Change (High Priority)
  Detected: 2026-02-12
  Source: LinkedIn via Brave Search

  Action: Update contact record and reach out?
```

### Weekly Digest
```
Contact Monitor — Weekly Digest
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Contacts Checked: 15/60
Changes Found: 3

  Job Changes (1):
    • John Rushby: SRI → DARPA

  Company News (1):
    • Galois, Inc.: Awarded DARPA PROOFS Phase 2

  New Publications (1):
    • Natasha Neogi: 2 new papers on ArXiv

  Stale Contacts (5):
    • 5 contacts not refreshed in 60+ days

Next cycle: 2026-02-19
Budget used: 8/10 /dogpile calls
```

## Priority Tiers

Contacts can be tagged with priority tiers:

```yaml
priority_tiers:
  critical:    # Check every 14 days
    - contacts with active deals
    - contacts in current programs
  standard:    # Check every 30 days (default)
    - general professional network
  cold:        # Check every 90 days
    - historical contacts
    - inactive relationships
```

## Schedule Configuration

```yaml
# monitor-contacts config
schedule:
  interval: weekly          # daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly
  day: sunday               # for weekly
  time: "02:00"             # off-peak
  budget_per_cycle: 10      # max /dogpile calls
  concurrency: 2            # parallel research

alerts:
  discord_channel: contacts # channel name
  webhook_url: ${DISCORD_CONTACTS_WEBHOOK}
  digest: weekly            # individual, weekly, both

thresholds:
  critical_staleness: 14    # days
  standard_staleness: 30    # days
  cold_staleness: 90        # days
```

## Memory + Taxonomy Integration

The skill integrates with the shared memory and taxonomy systems via
`memory_integration.py` for longitudinal contact freshness tracking:

- **Pre-hook (`recall_contact_changes`)**: Before checking a contact, recalls prior
  change history to surface patterns (e.g., frequent job moves, company instability).
- **Post-hook (`learn_contact_change`)**: After detecting a change, stores the change
  event (person, type, old/new values, severity) to memory for trend tracking.
- **Bridge keywords**: Precision, Resilience, Fragility, Corruption, Loyalty, Stealth
  (tuned to contact monitoring domain).
- **Tags**: `["monitor_contacts", person_name, "drift_tracking"] + bridges`

Gracefully degrades if `common.memory_client` or `taxonomy/taxonomy.py` are unavailable.
