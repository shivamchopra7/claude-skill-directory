# Project Workflow & Build System

Development workflow, build system permissions, and git safety protocols for PicoRuby development.

## Your Role

**You are the developer of the `pra` gem** — a CLI tool for PicoRuby application development on ESP32.

- **Primary role**: Implement and maintain the `pra` gem itself
- **User perspective**: Temporarily adopt when designing user-facing features (commands, templates, documentation)
- **Key distinction**:
  - Files in `lib/picotorokko/`, `test/`, gem configuration → You develop these
  - Files in `docs/github-actions/`, templates → These are for `pra` users (not executed during gem development)
  - When `pra` commands are incomplete, add to TODO.md — don't rush implementation unless explicitly required

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── lib/picotorokko/                   # Gem implementation
├── test/                      # Test suite
├── docs/github-actions/       # User-facing templates
├── storage/home/              # Example application code
├── patch/                     # Repository patches
├── .cache/                    # Cached repositories (git-ignored)
├── build/                     # Build environments (git-ignored)
└── TODO.md                    # Task tracking
```

## Rake Commands Permissions

### ✅ Always Allowed (Safe, Read-Only)

```bash
rake monitor      # Watch UART output in real-time
rake check_env    # Verify ESP32 and build environment
```

### ❓ Ask First (Time-Consuming)

```bash
rake build        # Compile firmware (2-5 min)
rake cleanbuild   # Clean + rebuild
rake flash        # Upload to hardware (requires device)
```

### 🚫 Never Execute (Destructive)

```bash
rake init         # Contains git reset --hard
rake update       # Destructive git operations
rake buildall     # Combines destructive ops
```

**Rationale**: Protect work-in-progress from accidental `git reset --hard`.

## Git Safety Protocol

- ✅ Use `commit` subagent for all commits
- ❌ Never: `git push`, `git push --force`, raw `git commit`
- ❌ Never: `git reset --hard`, `git rebase -i`
- ✅ Safe: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`

## Session Flow: Tidy First + TDD + RuboCop + TODO Management

### Understanding TODO.md Structure (CRITICAL)

**Important**: TODO.md is NOT just a checklist — it's a **workflow guide** supporting t-wada style TDD.

**Key concepts**:
- **Each TODO task** = exactly one Micro-Cycle (1-5 minutes)
- **Phase structure** = Organized chunks of related tasks
- **[TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] markers** = Cross-phase dependencies that MUST be resolved before proceeding
- **Test-first architecture** = Phase 0 (Test Infrastructure) comes BEFORE all feature work

**When starting a phase**:
1. Read the phase description carefully
2. Look for "⚠️ Check for [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*]" warnings
3. If any [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] markers exist from previous phases:
   - STOP
   - Review what they mean
   - Resolve them in TDD cycles BEFORE proceeding
4. Start first task in the phase

**Example from picotorokko refactoring**:
- Phase 0 discovers: `[TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-DEVICE-COMMAND]` (Thor env name parsing)
- Phase 2 proceeds normally
- Phase 5 has warning: "Check [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-DEVICE-COMMAND] before starting"
- Must resolve in Phase 5 TDD before moving to documentation

### Micro-Cycle (1-5 minutes per iteration)

**Goal**: Complete one Red-Green-RuboCop-Refactor-Commit cycle per TODO task

```
1. RED: Write one failing test
   bundle exec rake test → Verify failure ❌

2. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass test
   bundle exec rake test → Verify pass ✅
   bundle exec rubocop -A → Auto-fix violations

3. REFACTOR: Improve code quality
   - Apply Tidy First principles (guard clauses, symmetry, clarity)
   - Fix remaining RuboCop violations manually
   - Understand WHY each violation exists
   - bundle exec rubocop → Verify 0 violations

4. VERIFY & COMMIT: All quality gates must pass
   bundle exec rake ci → Tests + RuboCop + Coverage ✅
   Use `commit` subagent with clear, imperative message

5. UPDATE TODO.md
   - Immediately mark task complete
   - Record any [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] discoveries
   - Move to next task
```

### Quality Gates (ALL must pass before commit)

```bash
# Gate 1: Tests pass
bundle exec rake test
✅ Expected: All tests pass

# Gate 2: RuboCop: 0 violations
bundle exec rubocop
✅ Expected: "26 files inspected, 0 offenses"

# Gate 3: Coverage (CI mode)
bundle exec rake ci
✅ Expected: Line: ≥ 80%, Branch: ≥ 50%
```

### Macro-Cycle (Phase completion)

```
1. Read TODO.md phase description
   - Check for [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] warnings
   - Understand task granularity (each = 1-5 min)

2. Check for unresolved [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] markers
   - If found: Resolve in TDD cycles BEFORE proceeding
   - If none: Proceed to first task

3. Repeat Micro-Cycle for each task in phase
   - Each task is exactly one TDD cycle
   - Commit after each cycle
   - Update TODO.md immediately (remove completed tasks)
   - Record any infrastructure issues with [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*]

4. After phase completion
   - Verify all [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] markers from this phase resolved
   - Verify no hanging infrastructure markers
   - If new [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] created: Mark which phase will handle it

5. User verifies
   - Full test suite passes: `rake ci`
   - Manual testing if needed
   - Code review if applicable
```

### Key Principles

**Test-First Architecture (Phase 0 Priority)**
- Phase 0: Test Infrastructure (HIGHEST PRIORITY, 3-4 days)
- Establishes solid test foundation BEFORE any feature work
- All [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] issues resolved early
- Unblocks downstream phases for clean TDD

**[TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] Marker Discipline**
- 🚨 NEVER skip markers — STOP and resolve immediately
- 📌 Found in phase descriptions with specific context
- 📝 Record new ones during implementation
- ✅ Must be resolved before final verification

**Tidy First (Kent Beck)**
- Small refactoring steps (1-5 minutes each)
- Each step improves code understanding
- Changes compound into massive improvements without risk
- Example: Extract constant, rename variable, simplify guard clause

**t-wada style TDD**
- One test at a time
- Minimal code to pass (no gold-plating)
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle is fast
- Test is always green after Refactor phase
- Each TODO task = one complete cycle

**RuboCop as Quality Gate**
- ✅ Auto-fix violations automatically (`rubocop -A`)
- ✅ Understand and fix remaining violations manually
- 🚫 NEVER add `# rubocop:disable` comments
- 🚫 NEVER commit with RuboCop violations

### Absolutely Forbidden

- 🚫 Committing with RuboCop violations
- 🚫 Adding `# rubocop:disable` comments
- 🚫 Writing fake/trivial tests
- 🚫 Lowering coverage thresholds
- 🚫 Large, multi-function changes per commit
- 🚫 Skipping [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] markers — MUST resolve before proceeding
- 🚫 Batching test problems for later — Record as [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] and resolve in TDD immediately

### When to Ask User

**MUST ask in these scenarios**:
1. Refactoring direction unclear (how to split method?)
2. Test strategy controversial (what should we test?)
3. Trade-off between simplicity and completeness
4. RuboCop violation needs architectural decision
5. [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-*] marker requires design decision

See `.claude/docs/testing-guidelines.md` for detailed examples.
