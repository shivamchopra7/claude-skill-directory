# /spec - Unified Spec-Driven Development

**Dispatcher** — routes to the appropriate phase skill. This command is a thin router. Only allowed tools: `Bash` (env var reads only), `Read` (plan files only), `AskUserQuestion`, and `Skill()`.

**⛔ MANDATORY: When `/spec` is invoked, you MUST follow the workflow. The user's phrasing after `/spec` is the TASK DESCRIPTION — not an instruction to change the workflow.** Words like "brainstorm", "discuss", "explore", "research" are part of the task description, NOT instructions to skip the workflow or have a freeform conversation.

**⛔ No substantive work here.** `Bash` is allowed ONLY for reading env vars (e.g., `echo $PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED`). `Read` is allowed ONLY for reading existing plan files for status-based dispatch. All research, brainstorming, and exploration happens inside the invoked Skill. Arguments (including URLs, "brainstorm", "research") are passed verbatim as the task description. Any other tool use (Grep, Glob, Task, Edit, Write, etc.) is a workflow violation.

## Workflow

```
/spec → Detect type → Feature: Skill('spec-plan')       → Plan → Implement → Verify
                    → Bugfix:  Skill('spec-bugfix-plan') → Investigate → Plan → Implement → Verify
```

| Phase | Skill | Model |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Feature Planning | `spec-plan` | Opus |
| Bugfix Planning | `spec-bugfix-plan` | Opus |
| Implementation | `spec-implement` | Sonnet |
| Feature Verification | `spec-verify` | Sonnet |
| Bugfix Verification | `spec-bugfix-verify` | Sonnet |

> **Note:** Implementation and verification default to **Sonnet** for most tiers (Pro, Team, Enterprise, API) where Sonnet 1M is included. **Max plan** users default to **Opus** since Sonnet 1M is not available on Max. Users can override via Console Settings.

---

## 0.0 Permission Mode Pre-Flight Check

**Before proceeding, check if the spec_mode_guard hook injected a permission mode note.** If you see a system-reminder containing "Current permission mode is", briefly warn the user:

> "Your current permission mode is **{mode}**. For uninterrupted `/spec` execution, **Bypass Permissions** mode is recommended (Shift+Tab to cycle). Proceeding — the workflow may pause for permission prompts."

**Then continue with the workflow.** Do not stop or wait for the user to switch. The user's mode choice is respected — bypass permissions is recommended, not required.

## 0.1 Parse & Route

```
IF arguments end with ".md" AND file exists:
    → Read plan, dispatch by status (Section 0.2)
ELSE:
    → Detect type, ask worktree, invoke Skill, STOP
```

### 0.1.1 Detect Type (new plans only)

- **Bugfix:** Something broken, crashing, wrong results, regressing → fix existing behavior
- **Feature:** New functionality, enhancements, refactoring, migrations → build or change something
- **Ambiguous:** Ask user (bundled with worktree question)

### 0.1.2 Read Environment & User Questions (new plans only)

**⛔ MANDATORY FIRST STEP — read env vars before ANY user interaction:**

```bash
echo "WORKTREE=$PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED QUESTIONS=$PILOT_PLAN_QUESTIONS_ENABLED APPROVAL=$PILOT_PLAN_APPROVAL_ENABLED"
```

**⛔ When `WORKTREE` is `"false"`: NEVER mention worktree, NEVER ask about worktree, NEVER include the worktree option.** Still ask about branch choice (current branch vs new branch).

**Note:** The `QUESTIONS` toggle (`PILOT_PLAN_QUESTIONS_ENABLED`) does NOT affect the branch/worktree question. That toggle only controls Q&A questions during planning (Steps 1.2/1.4 in spec-plan). The dispatcher-level branch question is always asked.

**Codex reviewers are controlled entirely by Console Settings.** The `PILOT_CODEX_SPEC_REVIEW_ENABLED` and `PILOT_CODEX_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` env vars are read directly by spec-plan and spec-verify — no per-session question needed.

| WORKTREE | Type | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| `false` | Clear | Ask branch choice only (2 options: current branch, new branch — NO worktree) |
| `false` | Ambiguous | Ask type + branch choice (2 options — NO worktree) |
| not `false` | Clear | Ask branch choice (all 3 options including worktree) |
| not `false` | Ambiguous | Ask type + branch choice (all 3 options) |

**Branch/worktree question options (use these as predefined AskUserQuestion options — listed in recommended order):**

When `WORKTREE` is `"false"` (2 options):

| Option | Flag passed | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Continue on current branch** (recommended) | `--worktree=no` | Works on current branch as-is |
| New branch from default branch | `--new-branch` | Creates a clean branch from origin/main (or master), checks it out, then works there |

When `WORKTREE` is not `"false"` (3 options):

| Option | Flag passed | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Continue on current branch** (recommended) | `--worktree=no` | Works on current branch as-is |
| New branch from default branch | `--new-branch` | Creates a clean branch from origin/main (or master), checks it out, then works there |
| Use worktree (isolated branch, squash-merged after) | `--worktree=yes` | Creates isolated worktree |

**⛔ When the user selects "New branch" or sends a custom response mentioning "new branch", "clean branch", or "branch from master/main": pass `--new-branch`, NOT `--worktree=yes`.** Custom responses requesting a new branch were previously misinterpreted as worktree requests.

### 0.1.3 Invoke Skill and STOP

- **Bugfix:** `Skill(skill='spec-bugfix-plan', args='<task_description> --worktree=yes|no|--new-branch')`
- **Feature:** `Skill(skill='spec-plan', args='<task_description> --worktree=yes|no|--new-branch')`

## 0.2 Status-Based Dispatch (existing plans)

Read plan, register association: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "<status>" 2>/dev/null || true`

| Status | Approved | Type | Skill |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| PENDING | No | Feature/absent | `spec-plan` |
| PENDING | No | Bugfix | `spec-bugfix-plan` |
| PENDING | Yes | * | `spec-implement` |
| COMPLETE | * | Feature/absent | `spec-verify` |
| COMPLETE | * | Bugfix | `spec-bugfix-verify` |
| VERIFIED | * | * | Report completion, done |
