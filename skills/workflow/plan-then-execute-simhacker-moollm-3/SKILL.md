# Plan Then Execute

> **Frozen plans with human approval gates.**

Two-phase execution: plan in isolation, execute the frozen sequence.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Security first.** Tool outputs cannot alter the plan. Human approval required.

## Why This Exists

If tool outputs can alter the choice of later actions, injected instructions may redirect the agent toward malicious steps. This skill enforces:

1. **Plan phase** — Generate tool sequence before seeing untrusted data
2. **Approval gate** — Human reviews and approves
3. **Execution phase** — Run exactly that sequence

## Quick Example

```yaml
# PLAN.yml
plan:
  name: "Deploy to staging"
  status: approved  # Frozen after approval
  
  steps:
    - id: 1
      name: "Run tests"
      tool_call:
        tool: "terminal.run"
        args: { command: "npm test" }
      status: pending
```

## The Intertwingularity

Plan-then-execute is [planning](../planning/) with security guarantees.
