# Dream - Private Overnight Operator Mode

> **Cross-vendor analog:** Anthropic Managed Agents Dreaming (research preview, May 2026). Same shape — scheduled session review, pattern extraction, memory curation between runs — but local, off the API, and against any model.

`/dream` is the interactive face of the Dream system. It should drive the same
engine as `ao overnight`; do not invent a parallel workflow.

## Purpose

Use Dream to:

- preview or persist Dream setup and scheduler assistance
- run a bounded private overnight compounding pass against the real `.agents/`
  corpus
- render and interpret the latest morning report, including Dream Council and
  DreamScape sections
- explain the difference between the private local Dream lane and the public
  nightly proof harness

## Routing

Map user intent to one of three lanes:

| Intent | Command | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| bootstrap, install, configure Dream | `ao overnight setup` | Default to preview. Use `--apply` only when the user explicitly wants config or scheduler artifacts persisted. Detects Tier 1 local curator separately from Tier 2 Dream Council runners. |
| inspect or feed local Gemma curator | `ao overnight curator status|diagnose|enqueue|compact|event` | Use for Ollama/Gemma worker health, allowlisted queue jobs, pending LOG compaction, and bounded needs-review events. |
| run Dream now | `ao overnight start` | Include `--goal` when the user provides one. Use `--runner` and `--creative-lane` only when the user asks for multimodel or wildcard analysis. |
| inspect a prior run | `ao overnight report` | Use `--from <dir-or-summary.json>` for non-default report paths. |

## Compounding Loop (v2)

Dream v2 runs a bounded outer loop of `INGEST -> REDUCE -> MEASURE` iterations until a halt condition fires: wall-clock budget exhausted, plateau (K sub-epsilon deltas in a row), regression beyond a per-metric floor, or metadata integrity failure. Each iteration is atomic and checkpointed so any rollback leaves the corpus clean. Dream is strictly knowledge-only.

Anti-goals (hard constraints):

- NEVER mutates source code.
- NEVER invokes `/rpi` or any code-mutating flow.
- NEVER performs git operations (no commits, branches, push, rebase, checkout).
- NEVER creates symlinks anywhere.
- No swarm/gc agent fan-out inside iterations. Bounded in-process read-only
  finding generators may run concurrently during INGEST, but REDUCE remains the
  single serialized writer for `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl`.

## Tier 1 Curator And Trigger Mesh

Dream can expose a local Tier 1 curator through `dream.local_curator.*`. The
first supported shape is Ollama + Gemma, backed by an operator-owned worker
directory such as `D:\dream` and a vault such as `D:\vault`. This is not a Dream
Council runner: Gemma drafts, lints, triages, and writes auditable queue or event
records; Codex and Claude remain Tier 2 review/synthesis runners; humans own
promotion into durable authored memory.

Use `ao overnight curator status --json` to check the worker, queue, model, and
Ollama endpoint. Use `ao overnight curator enqueue --kind lint-wiki|dream-seed`
or `--kind ingest-claude-session --source <path> --chunk-start <n> --chunk-end
<n>` only for allowlisted knowledge jobs. Use `ao overnight curator event` when
Gemma or a local SOC signal needs Tier 2 attention. Events carry source,
severity, desired action, escalation target, and budget; no runner should
recursively invoke another runner without consuming an explicit event budget and
leaving a ledger entry.

## Key Rules

- Keep the shared control plane authoritative. Dream settings live under
  `dream.*`; do not duplicate config logic inside the skill.
- Keep platform semantics honest. Never promise scheduled execution on a
  sleeping laptop.
- Keep the first slice bounded. Dream is for close-loop, defrag preview,
  metrics, retrieval proof, optional briefing, and optional artifact-mediated
  council synthesis.
- Do not imply tracked source-code edits overnight unless the runtime actually
  supports them.
- GitHub nightly is the public proof harness. Dream is the private local
  engine.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Resolve the operator lane

Interpret the request as `setup`, `start`, or `report`.

Examples:

```bash
/dream setup
/dream setup --apply --runner codex --runner claude --at 01:30
/dream start "close the loop on today's auth work"
/dream report
/dream report --from .agents/overnight/latest
```

### Step 2: Setup lane

Use `ao overnight setup` to inspect the host, available runtimes, scheduler
mode, and keep-awake behavior.

```bash
ao overnight setup
ao overnight setup --apply --runner codex --runner claude --at 01:30
```

Default behavior:

- Preview first when the user asks how Dream would work on this machine.
- Persist with `--apply` only when the user explicitly asks to save config or
  generate scheduler artifacts.

Expected outputs:

- a config preview in terminal, JSON, or YAML
- optional generated scheduler assistance under `.agentops/generated/dream/`
- optional `dream.local_curator` config when a supported local curator is
  configured or detected

### Step 2a: Local curator lane

Use `ao overnight curator` when the user asks about Gemma, the local worker, the
SOC trigger path, or Tier 1 drafts.

```bash
ao overnight curator status --json
ao overnight curator diagnose
ao overnight curator enqueue --kind lint-wiki
ao overnight curator enqueue --kind dream-seed
ao overnight curator compact --dry-run
ao overnight curator event --source local-soc --severity high --desired-action "review alert cluster" --budget 1
```

Do not promote Tier 1 drafts directly into authored content. Treat draft
promotion as Tier 2 or human review work.

### Step 3: Bedtime run lane

Use `ao overnight start` for the actual local run.

```bash
ao overnight start --goal "close the loop on today's auth work"
ao overnight start --goal "stabilize release follow-ups" --runner codex --runner claude --creative-lane
/dream start --queue=.agents/dream/tonight.md
/dream start --max-iterations=3
/dream start --warn-only=false
```

Expected behavior:

- operates against the real repo-local `.agents` corpus
- writes `summary.json` and `summary.md`
- degrades honestly when soft-fail steps or keep-awake helpers are unavailable

### Step 4: Morning report lane

Use `ao overnight report` to render the latest Dream result.

```bash
ao overnight report
ao overnight report --from .agents/overnight/latest
ao overnight report --from .agents/overnight/latest/summary.json
```

Focus the response on four questions:

1. What state did I wake up to?
2. What ran overnight?
3. What degraded or failed?
4. What should I do first?

## Output

- Dream setup preview or persisted `dream.*` config with optional scheduler
  assistance artifacts
- Dream morning report artifacts:
  - `.agents/overnight/<run>/summary.json`
  - `.agents/overnight/<run>/summary.md`
- A concise operator summary with degraded items and the single highest-signal
  next action
- v2 morning reports also include per-iteration sub-summaries, composite
  `fitness_delta`, and `plateau_reason` / `regression_reason` when applicable

## Examples

```text
Help me get Dream working on this Mac without pretending launchd survives sleep.
```

```text
Run Dream tonight with Codex and Claude, goal: stabilize the Homebrew release follow-up.
```

```text
Read the latest Dream report and tell me the first move.
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `ao overnight setup` suggests `manual` scheduler mode | Host scheduler semantics are ambiguous or unsupported | Keep the run operator-armed, or use generated assistance only after reviewing the host behavior |
| Dream report shows degraded keep-awake | `caffeinate` or the platform helper is unavailable | Continue with the degraded report; do not claim the machine will stay awake |
| No morning report exists | Dream has not been run yet or the output dir is different | Run `ao overnight start`, or point `ao overnight report --from` at the correct directory |
| User expects GitHub nightly to replace local Dream | CI proof harness and local Dream are different surfaces | Explain that nightly proves the contract, while Dream operates on the private local corpus |

## Delineation vs /evolve

| Lane | Runs | Mutates code? | Mutates corpus? | Outer loop? | Budget |
|------|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| `/dream` | nightly, private local | **No** | **Yes (heavy)** | **Yes (convergence)** | wall-clock + plateau |
| `/evolve` | daytime, operator-driven | Yes (via `/rpi`) | Yes (light) | Yes | cycle cap |

Dream owns the knowledge compounding layer; `/evolve` owns the code compounding layer. Both share fitness-measurement substrate via `corpus.Compute` / `ao goals measure`. Run Dream overnight, then start each day with `/evolve` against the freshly-compounded corpus with a clean fitness baseline.
