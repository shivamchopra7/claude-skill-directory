# Diamond Progress Skill

Progress a diamond through phases with full theory gate validation. At delivery completion, runs an executable checklist that GATES progression.

## Workflow

1. **Identify transition**: From [current phase] to [next phase] at [scale].

1b. **Cognitive Forcing (before gate evaluation)**:

   Before running gates, ask the human for their unprimed judgment:

   > "Before I check the gates — do you think we're ready to move from [current] to [next]? What's your gut say?"

   Wait for the response. Record it. Then run the gates. After presenting results, compare:

   > "You said [X]. The gates say [Y]. Where do we differ?"

   The human's instinct often catches risks the gates miss. If the human says "not ready" but gates pass, investigate — the human may be sensing something the evidence hasn't captured yet.

   *Source: Buçinca, Malaya & Gajos (Cognitive Forcing Functions, Harvard CHI/CSCW 2021). Applied after Hoskins transcript analysis — Drew's product judgment consistently outperformed the agent's gate-based assessment.*

2. **Run all required theory gates** (per theory-gates.md transition matrix):
   - For each gate:
     a. State the gate name and source theory.
     b. **Surface the suggested skill**: "Run `/skill-name` to satisfy this gate."
     c. Evaluate pass criteria against available evidence.
     d. Record Pass / Fail / Insufficient Evidence.
     e. If Fail: document what is missing, recommend the skill to run, and do NOT proceed.

   **CRITICAL — Perspective conflict check (do this BEFORE evaluating any other gate)**:
   Before checking any gate status, read `canvas/opportunities.yml` and inspect the Four Risks risk LEVELS for the active solution. Do NOT rely on `theory_gates_status.four_risks` in active.yml — that only records whether risks are documented, not whether they conflict. You must read the actual `value.level`, `usability.level`, `feasibility.level`, `viability.level` values.

   If TWO OR MORE risk dimensions are rated HIGH, or if perspectives directly contradict each other (e.g., value says "build it" but usability/feasibility say "don't"), this is a **perspective conflict** — not a simple gate failure. STOP evaluating other gates and jump to step 2b immediately. This takes priority over all other gate checks.

2b. **Resolve perspective conflict** (if detected in step 2):
   Do NOT continue to steps 3-6. A perspective conflict must be resolved before any other gate evaluation matters. Follow this procedure:

   1. **Name the conflict explicitly** in the decision log: "Perspective conflict: [type]" — use the vocabulary from `engine/perspective-resolution.md` (value-vs-feasibility, usability-vs-feasibility, value-vs-viability, usability-vs-viability, three-way).
   2. **Classify the conflict type** per the resolution framework.
   3. **State each perspective's position**:
      - Product perspective: what does the value evidence say?
      - Design perspective: what does the usability evidence say?
      - Engineering perspective: what does the feasibility evidence say?
   4. **Apply the resolution methods in order of preference**:
      - Constraint-based: Can all three perspectives be satisfied within acceptable thresholds?
      - Phased: Can we deliver in stages? (Phase 1 = MVP addressing highest risk, Phase 2 = polish)
      - Evidence-based: Can we test the disputed dimension? (Run `/assumption-test` on the riskiest assumption)
      - Scope reduction: Can we remove features until all perspectives align?
   5. **Log the resolution** in decision-log.md with: the conflict type, each perspective's position, the resolution method chosen, and why.
   6. **Block progression**: Report "Progression blocked: perspective conflict ([type]). Recommended resolution: [method]."
   7. Do NOT proceed to step 3 or beyond. The conflict must be resolved first.

   The perspective resolution framework (`engine/perspective-resolution.md`) is the authoritative reference. The anti-pattern to avoid is Perspective Suppression — resolving a conflict by ignoring one perspective.

2c. **Build-to-learn awareness NUDGE** (Define → Develop transitions only):
   At the point of entering Develop, surface this prompt to the human:
   > "Are you building to learn or building to earn right now? Discovery work (prototypes, spikes, experiments) can use lighter gates. Delivery work (shipping to users) must meet full DoD."
   This is awareness only — it does not change gate requirements or routing. The human's answer is informational context, not a gate input.
   *Source: Cagan (SVPG), Patton (build to learn vs build to earn). Added as NUDGE per risk analysis — conceptual awareness, not process gate.*

3. **Calculate confidence**:
   - Apply scoring rules from confidence-thresholds.yml.
   - Look up `project_type` and `dogfood` from `diamonds/active.yml`.
   - Apply `project_type_adaptations` from confidence-thresholds.yml:
     - `effective_threshold = base_threshold * threshold_multiplier`
     - If `dogfood: true`: `effective_threshold *= dogfood_modifier.additional_threshold_multiplier`
     - `effective_min_sources = ceil(base_min_sources * min_sources_multiplier)`
   - Compare confidence to the **effective** threshold (not the base).
   - Report both: "Confidence: 0.55. Effective threshold: 0.57 (base 0.85, adapted for solo_product). Needs: one more evidence source to cross."

4. **Check human approval requirement**:
   - Per confidence-thresholds.yml, is human approval required/recommended/optional?
   - If required: present assessment and wait for approval.

5. **Run bias check**: Execute bias-check for the current stage.

6. **Run corrections check**: Review corrections.md for relevant entries.

6b. **Check trio perspective coverage** (Torres Product Trio):
   - For each gate evaluated in step 2, verify all three perspectives (product/design/engineering) are documented.
   - Each perspective must have evidence or an explicit "N/A: [reason]" justification.
   - Missing perspectives without justification = **GATE FAILED** (Perspective Skip anti-pattern).
   - See `engine/theory-gates.md` §Trio Perspective Requirement for per-scale guidance.
   - Note: Perspective CONFLICTS (2+ HIGH risk dimensions) are caught in step 2b, not here. This step checks for missing perspectives, not conflicting ones.

7. **If transition is Deliver -> Complete: RUN EXECUTABLE DoD CHECKLIST** (see below)

8. **Decision**:
   - All gates pass + confidence met + approval (if needed) + DoD pass (if delivery) = **PROGRESS**
   - Any REVIEW item fails = **blocked** (list specific blockers with suggested skills)
   - Confidence below threshold = **NEEDS EVIDENCE** (list what would help)

9. **If progressing**:
   - Update diamond state in active.yml.
   - **Render the updated journey map**: Follow `.claude/engine/wayfinding.md` to show the user where they've moved to. This makes the transition visible — the user sees their position shift on the map.
   - Log transition in decision-log.md. If threshold was adapted, include: "Threshold adapted from [base] to [effective] because project_type=[type]. Would increase with [action]."
   - Update product-journal.md.
   - Identify if child diamonds should be spawned.
   - **Capture learnings** (see Learning Capture section below)

10. **If blocked or needs evidence**:
    - Report in plain language: "Can't mark this done yet because [reason]."
    - List each failed item with its suggested skill
    - Do not progress. Stay in current phase.
    - At **L0 / L1 / L2 / L5** diamonds, if the Evidence gate is "Insufficient Evidence" and `.claude/jit-tooling/active-metrics.yml` is configured, suggest `/metrics-pull` as one route to strengthen external signal. If `active-metrics.yml` is missing, suggest `/metrics-detect` first. (v0.14: `external_data` from snapshots satisfies the Evidence gate's behavioral-data criterion but does NOT replace `external_human` requirements at L2 Develop->Deliver.)

11. **Always communicate in plain language**:
    - Use status-translations.md for all state descriptions
    - Include contextual confidence explanation
    - Suggest specific skills for any gaps

## Executable Definition of Done (Deliver -> Complete ONLY)

When transitioning from Deliver to Complete, run this checklist. Items marked `REVIEW` block progression. Items marked `PROMPTED` are asked but don't block.

### Auto-Checked (Machine Verifiable)

Check `product_type` from `diamonds/active.yml` to determine which auto-checks apply.

**For software and ai_tool (code components):**

**Testing (G-V7 REVIEW)**:
- Check: Do test files exist? (glob for *.test.*, *.spec.*, Tests/*, __tests__/*)
- If no tests AND project has source files: **GATE FAILED**
- Message: "No tests found. Tests must exist before marking delivery complete. Run /reflexion to add tests."
- If tests exist: run them and verify they pass

**Type Safety (REVIEW for typed languages)**:
- Check: If tsconfig.json, *.swift, *.cs, go.mod, Cargo.toml detected: run type checker
- If type errors: **GATE FAILED**

**Linting (REVIEW if linter detected)**:
- Check: If linter config exists (.eslintrc, biome.json, .swiftlint.yml, ruff.toml): run it
- If lint errors: **GATE FAILED**

**For content products (content_course, content_publication, content_media):**

**Content Quality (REVIEW)**:
- Check: Are `content-metrics.yml#quality_review` flags all true? (sme_reviewed, accessibility_checked, fact_checked, style_consistent, learning_objectives_met)
- If any flag is false: **GATE FAILED** -- "Content quality review incomplete. Set the relevant flags in content-metrics.yml after completing review."
- Fallback: If content-metrics.yml doesn't exist yet, ask: "Has content been reviewed? Create content-metrics.yml and mark quality_review flags."

**For ai_tool:**

**Eval & Safety (REVIEW)**:
- Check: Are `ai-tool-metrics.yml#prompt_quality` fields populated (not null)? Specifically: accuracy_score, consistency_score, safety_score.
- If any are null: **GATE FAILED** -- "Prompt/model must be evaluated. Populate accuracy_score, consistency_score, and safety_score in ai-tool-metrics.yml."
- Check: Is `ai-tool-metrics.yml#prompt_quality.last_evaluated` set?
- If null: **GATE FAILED** -- "No evaluation timestamp. Run eval and record the date."

**For all product types:**

**Secrets (G-S1 BLOCK)**:
- Check: Scan all project files for secret patterns (same as gate.sh)
- If secrets found: **GATE FAILED**

### Delivery-Type Dependent (from canvas-guidance.yml)

**For user_facing work (G-V2, G-V8, G-V9 REVIEW)**:
- Check: Has services.yml been assessed? (count of "not-assessed" < 15)
- If all 15 are "not-assessed": **GATE FAILED** -- "Run /service-check before completing."
- Check: Has accessibility been considered? (any evidence of a11y work)
- If no evidence: **GATE FAILED** -- "Run /a11y-check for user-facing work."
- Check: Has usability been evaluated? (Nielsen's 10 heuristics via /usability-check)
- If no evidence: **GATE FAILED** -- "Run /usability-check for user-facing interfaces." (G-V10)

**For api_service or permission_requiring work (G-S2 REVIEW)**:
- Check: Does threat-model.yml have components listed?
- If empty: **GATE FAILED** -- "Run /threat-model for work that handles data or requires permissions."

**For data-handling work (G-S3 REVIEW)**:
- Check: Does privacy-assessment.yml have principles assessed?
- If all "not-assessed" and product handles user data: **GATE FAILED** -- "Run /privacy-check."

### Always Required (REVIEW)

**Success criteria declared (G-V11 REVIEW)**:
- Check: Does decision-log.md have success criteria recorded for this delivery (from `/preflight`)?
- If no success criteria found: **GATE FAILED** -- "No success criteria declared. Run `/preflight` and declare what will be true after delivery and how to verify it."
- If criteria exist: verify each criterion is satisfied. Report pass/fail per criterion.
- This catches the denominator problem: without declared criteria, "done" = "whatever we built."

**Decision log (G-P4)**:
- Check: Does decision-log.md have an entry for this delivery?
- If no entry since diamond was created: **GATE FAILED** -- "Log the delivery decision."

**BVSSH Quick-Check (Smart -- Fix 6)**:
- Prompt the user/agent with product-type-appropriate questions:

  Happier covers four stakeholders (Smart): **customers, colleagues, citizens, and climate**.

  **Software:**
  - "Better: Did code quality improve or degrade?"
  - "Value: Did we deliver measurable user value?"
  - "Sooner: Was deployment flow efficient? Any unnecessary delays?"
  - "Safer: Did we maintain security, reliability, and trust?"
  - "Happier: How is developer/team satisfaction? User advocacy? Was compute usage proportionate to value delivered?"

  **Content (course, publication, media):**
  - "Better: Did content quality and learning outcomes improve?"
  - "Value: Will this content help the audience accomplish their goal?"
  - "Sooner: Was production cadence maintained? Any bottlenecks?"
  - "Safer: Is the content accurate, accessible, and free from harm?"
  - "Happier: How is creator satisfaction? Audience sentiment? Positive societal contribution?"

  **AI tool:**
  - "Better: Did eval scores improve? Is output quality higher?"
  - "Value: Does the tool reliably help users accomplish their task?"
  - "Sooner: Was the prompt/model iteration cycle efficient?"
  - "Safer: Are safety scores acceptable? Bias assessed? Regulatory status current?"
  - "Happier: How is the builder's satisfaction? User feedback positive? Token/compute usage proportionate (not brute-force waste)?"

  **Service offering:**
  - "Better: Did delivery quality improve? Client satisfaction up?"
  - "Value: Did the client get measurable value from the engagement?"
  - "Sooner: Was delivery lead time acceptable? Any waiting waste?"
  - "Safer: Were commitments met? Trust maintained? No scope creep harm?"
  - "Happier: How is your satisfaction as a service provider? Client sentiment? Sustainable resource usage?"
- Record in bvssh-health.yml assessment_history
- **REVIEW**: Must answer all 5 (even briefly) before completing

### Prompted (Not Blocking)

**Delivery journal (PROMPTED)**:
- "What was built? What technical decisions were made? What surprised you?"
- Auto-draft entry from canvas diff if possible
- Present to user for confirmation

**Patterns (PROMPTED)**:
- "Did you discover any reusable patterns? I'll draft for patterns.md."
- Check corrections.md for entries logged during this diamond -- suggest generalizing any

**Retrospective (PROMPTED)**:
- "What went well? What didn't? What to change next time?"
- Suggest /retrospective for deeper review

## Non-Progression Paths: Pivot, Park, Kill

Not every diamond makes forward progress. Sometimes the right move is to reframe, pause, or abandon. `/diamond-progress` handles these paths too, via subcommands:

- `/diamond-progress pivot` — reframe the diamond's scope, audience, or JTBD with new evidence
- `/diamond-progress park` — mark the diamond as inactive-pending-conditions
- `/diamond-progress kill` — abandon with a documented reason

All three are **sanctioned exits** from a stuck diamond. They are not failure modes — they are the system working correctly when evidence tells you the current direction is wrong.

Addresses dogfood report finding T5: "Stop-the-diamond pattern has no escape valve."

### Pivot (reframe with new evidence)

Use when evidence invalidates the current framing but the underlying need is still valid. Example: macos-fileviewer pivoted from "replace QuickLook for all devs" to "serve terminal-resistant devs specifically" after mocked-persona findings.

**Workflow**:
1. State the invalidating evidence (what did we learn that broke the old framing?)
2. Propose the new framing (scope change, audience change, JTBD refinement)
3. Log decision in decision-log.md with:
   - Original framing
   - Invalidating evidence
   - New framing
   - Theory: which framework informed the pivot (Torres "evidence-guided", Cagan "value risk", etc.)
   - Confidence delta (the pivot should REDUCE confidence initially — you have less evidence for the new framing)
4. Update `diamonds/active.yml`:
   - Phase often regresses (e.g., Define → Discover) to gather evidence on the new framing
   - Confidence resets to match the new framing's evidence level
   - Add `pivot_history` entry listing old and new framings
5. Update relevant canvas files (purpose.yml, jobs-to-be-done.yml, opportunities.yml)
6. Do NOT archive the old framing — keep it as a pivot_history entry so future agents can see the learning

### Park (inactive-pending-conditions)

Use when the diamond cannot progress right now but may be revisitable later. Example: "park until I have time to do real user interviews" or "park until upstream dependency X ships."

**Workflow**:
1. State the blocking condition(s) — what would un-park this?
2. Log decision in decision-log.md with:
   - Reason for parking
   - Conditions for resuming
   - Expected timeline (best guess)
   - Theory: Goldratt ToC (constraint waiting on resolution) or Torres (evidence insufficient, acceptable to pause)
3. Update `diamonds/active.yml`:
   - State → `parked`
   - Add `parked_reason`, `parked_at`, `resume_conditions` fields
4. Parked diamonds remain in active.yml but do not count against WIP limits
5. `/feedback-review` and `/diamond-assess` surface parked diamonds with their resume conditions at session start

### Kill (abandon with documented reason)

Use when the diamond cannot be rescued via pivot or park. Example: the opportunity turned out to be imaginary (no real users, no demand), or the solution space has been exhausted, or the project direction has fundamentally changed.

**Workflow**:
1. State the reason for killing — what evidence makes this diamond dead?
2. Confirm with user (kill is destructive) — present the reason, ask for explicit confirmation
3. Log decision in decision-log.md with:
   - Final state of the diamond
   - Reason for kill
   - Alternatives considered (why not pivot, why not park?)
   - Theory: Kahneman (sunk cost fallacy — kill is correct when evidence says continuing is worse than stopping)
   - What we learned (the learning is the deliverable for a killed diamond)
4. Update `diamonds/active.yml`:
   - Move to `killed_diamonds` section (NOT deleted — canvas data is preserved)
   - Add `killed_at`, `killed_reason`, `learnings` fields
5. Do NOT delete canvas artifacts associated with the killed diamond — they are learning for future work
6. Capture the learning in `memory/patterns.md` and `memory/corrections.md` as appropriate
7. **Record cycle in `canvas/cycle-history.yml`**: Killed diamonds are terminal states. Record predicted ICE/effort, actual outcome as "killed", reason, and phase at kill. This feeds adaptive thresholds and pattern detection.

### Dogfood Mode Modifier (from canvas-guidance.yml)

When the project has `dogfood: true` set, stop conditions become Mycelium learnings rather than project deaths. In dogfood mode, a killed diamond generates a dogfood report entry in `.claude/evals/dogfood-reports/` instead of only being logged as a project kill. The framework gap caught is the real deliverable.

---

## Learning Capture (After Every Phase Transition)

After EVERY successful transition (not just Deliver->Complete):

1. **Corrections**: "Were any mistakes made during this phase? I'll draft a corrections.md entry."
2. **Patterns**: "Did anything work particularly well that's worth reusing?"
3. **Delivery journal** (delivery phases only): "What implementation decisions and learnings should be recorded?"
4. **Product journal** (discovery phases only): "What insights changed our understanding?"

Draft entries for the user. Present for confirmation before saving. This captures learning at the moment of discovery, not retrospectively.

## Counter-Argument Check (Bias Mitigation)

Before progressing the diamond OR signing off on a phase transition, draft a one-line counter-argument: *"What's the strongest case AGAINST this transition — what gate is borderline, what evidence is weakest, what regression risk is being underweighted?"* If you can't articulate one, run `/devils-advocate` before proceeding.

This addresses the bias cluster documented in corrections.md (L5 sycophancy 2026-04-20, eval overfitting 2026-04-30, sharper-framing-isn't-righter 2026-05-03). Common shape: agent prefers what feels right over what evidence supports under competing pressure (be helpful vs. be honest, advance vs. regress). Phase-transition reviews are the canonical context — the agent is incentivized to move forward and may underweight the case for staying or regressing.

Especially important at L4→complete (DoD signoff) and L5 transitions (where the L5-sycophancy correction explicitly named promotional-language drift).
