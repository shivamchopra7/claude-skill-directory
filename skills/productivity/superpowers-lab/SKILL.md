# Superpowers Lab

Experimental skills that extend Claude Code with innovative techniques and tools under active development. These skills enable new automation patterns and capabilities.

## Included Skills

### using-tmux-for-interactive-commands

Enables Claude Code to control interactive CLI tools through tmux sessions for automation of traditionally manual workflows.

**Supported Tools:**
- Interactive text editors (vim, nano, emacs)
- Terminal UI applications (menuconfig, htop)
- Interactive REPLs (Python, Node, Ruby, etc.)
- Interactive git operations (rebase -i, add -p)
- Any terminal-based tool requiring keyboard navigation

**How It Works:**
- Creates detached tmux sessions
- Sends keystrokes programmatically
- Captures terminal output in real-time
- Enables full automation of interactive workflows
