# Context Health

## Overview
Provide a consistent diagnostic workflow for claude-ctx environments: verify config integrity, detect duplicates, surface redundancies, and report actionable issues.

## When to Use
- Checking system health after changes to agents, modes, or rules
- Troubleshooting unexpected claude-ctx behavior
- Performing periodic maintenance checks

Avoid when:
- The task is unrelated to claude-ctx configuration or context

3. Run checks and gather findings.
4. Summarize issues by severity.
5. Recommend fixes and next steps.

## Output
- Diagnostic report with severity levels

## Common Mistakes
- Running fixes without reviewing findings
- Skipping context scope verification
