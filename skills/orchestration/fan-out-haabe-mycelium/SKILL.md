# Fan-Out / Fan-In Orchestration

## When to Use
- OST has 2+ solutions for the same opportunity that need parallel exploration
- Independent delivery work items that can be parallelized
- Multiple research streams needed simultaneously

## Workflow

### 1. Prepare (Lead Agent)
- Read canvas/opportunities.yml
- Identify solutions needing parallel work
- For each: identify riskiest assumption and design test

### 2. Fan-Out (Spawn Workers)
For each solution:
- Spawn subagent or Agent Team member
- Provide: clear task, read-only canvas context, worktree isolation, time bound
- Each worker runs independently

### 3. Fan-In (Collect Results)
- Collect all worker results
- Update ICE scores in canvas
- Run `/bias-check` on combined findings
- Select winner(s) based on evidence
- Log decision in decision-log.md

### Leaf Bakeoff Mode

When comparing competing OST leaves for the same opportunity:
- Each worker returns a structured **scorecard** (Four Risks + ICE + assumption test result + segment fit)
- Lead agent applies **winner selection rules**: clear winner (>20% ICE delta), close race (tiebreaker), segment split (both advance), both fail (archive and re-evaluate)
- Losers are archived to `canvas/archived-solutions.yml` with full evidence snapshot

See `.claude/orchestration/leaf-bakeoff.md` for the complete bakeoff protocol.

## Rules
- Workers NEVER write to canvas (lead agent does)
- Workers NEVER progress diamonds
- Lead agent ALWAYS runs bias check on combined results
- Minimum 2 workers for meaningful comparison
- Maximum 3 leaves per bakeoff (respects L3 WIP ceiling)

See `.claude/orchestration/agent-teams.md` for full orchestration patterns.
