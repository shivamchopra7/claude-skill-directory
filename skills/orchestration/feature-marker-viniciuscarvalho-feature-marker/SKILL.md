name: feature-marker
description: >
  End-to-end feature development orchestrator. Generates PRD, TechSpec, and Tasks,
  then executes a 4-phase workflow: Plan → Implement → Test → PR. Supports
  checkpoint/resume, context-aware entry, and auto-detects GitHub, Azure DevOps,
  or GitLab for PR creation. Platform-agnostic: iOS/Swift, Node.js/TypeScript,
  Rust, Python, Go.

  ALWAYS use this skill when the user says "implement this feature", "build
  feature X", "start a new feature", "create a PRD", "generate tech spec",
  "break down tasks", "feature workflow", "plan this feature", "implement
  from spec", "run the full workflow", "resume feature", "continue where I
  left off", asks to go from requirements to implementation, wants to automate
  feature development end-to-end, mentions PRD-to-PR pipelines, or says
  "/feature-marker". Also trigger when the user mentions "spec-driven mode",
  "checkpoint", or asks to generate tasks from a PRD or tech spec.

# feature-marker

Automates feature development with a 4-phase workflow:

1. **Plan** — Validates/generates PRD, TechSpec, Tasks; creates implementation plan.
2. **Implement** — Executes tasks with progress tracking and per-task checkpoints.
3. **Test** — Runs platform-appropriate test suites and build validation.
4. **PR** — Commits with the enhanced `/commit` command and creates a Pull Request.

## Platform Support

| Stack     | Detection                             | Test              | Lint              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| iOS/Swift | `*.xcodeproj`, `Package.swift`        | `swift test`      | `swiftlint`       |
| Node.js   | `package.json`                        | `jest` / `vitest` | `{pm} run lint`   |
| Rust      | `Cargo.toml`                          | `cargo test`      | `cargo clippy`    |
| Python    | `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` | `pytest`          | `ruff` / `flake8` |
| Go        | `go.mod`                              | `go test ./...`   | `go vet`          |

## Usage

```
/feature-marker <feature-slug>
```

The skill reads project state on every invocation and presents a single confirmation:

- Checkpoint found → offers to resume from saved phase
- Tasks exist → suggests implement → test → pr
- PRD/TechSpec exist → suggests generating missing files first
- Nothing found → starts from PRD generation

For programmatic use: `/feature-marker --mode <mode> <feature-slug>`
where mode is one of: `full` · `tasks-only` · `spec-driven` · `test-only` · `prd-only`

## Prerequisites

Commands in `~/.claude/commands/`:

- `create-prd.md`
- `generate-spec.md`
- `generate-tasks.md`

Templates in `~/.claude/docs/specs/`:

- `prd-template.md`
- `techspec-template.md`
- `tasks-template.md`

## Project Structure

**Feature documents** (generated in project):

```
./tasks/{feature-slug}/
├── prd.md
├── techspec.md
├── tasks.md
└── {num}_task.md   (individual task files)
```

**State directory** (checkpoint & progress):

```
.claude/feature-state/{feature-slug}/
├── checkpoint.json
├── platform-context.json
├── analysis.md
├── plan.md
├── progress.md
├── test-results.md
└── pr-url.txt
```

## Auto-Installed Dependencies

**product-manager skill** (Plan phase): advanced PRD analysis. Installed via `npx` if missing; non-blocking.

**commit command** (PR phase): conventional commits with pre-commit validation. Copied from bundled `resources/commit.md` if missing; non-blocking.

**spec-workflow skills** (spec-driven mode only): lazy-installed from bundled resources on first use.

## Checkpoint & Resume

If interrupted, re-invoke with the same feature slug:

```
/feature-marker prd-user-authentication
```

The skill detects the checkpoint and offers to resume from the saved phase and task index.

## Configuration

Override defaults with `.feature-marker.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "pr_skill": "custom-pr-skill",
  "skip_pr": false,
  "test_command": "npm run test:ci",
  "docs_path": "./tasks",
  "state_path": ".claude/feature-state"
}
```
