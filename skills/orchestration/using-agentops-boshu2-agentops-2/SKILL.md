# AgentOps Operating Model

AgentOps is the operational layer for coding agents.

Publicly, it gives you four things:

- **Bookkeeping** — captured learnings, findings, and reusable context
- **Validation** — plan and code review before work ships
- **Primitives** — single skills, hooks, and CLI surfaces
- **Flows** — named compositions like `/research`, `/validation`, and `/rpi`

Technically, AgentOps acts as a context compiler: raw session signal becomes reusable knowledge, compiled prevention, and better next work.

## Core Flow: RPI

```
Research → Plan → Implement → Validate
    ↑                            │
    └──── Knowledge Flywheel ────┘
```

### Research Phase

```bash
/research <topic>      # Deep codebase exploration
ao search "<query>"    # Search existing knowledge
ao search "<query>" --cite retrieved  # Record adoption when a search result is reused
ao lookup <id>         # Pull full content of specific learning
ao lookup --query "x"  # Search knowledge by relevance
```

**Output:** `.agents/research/<topic>.md`

### Plan Phase

```bash
/pre-mortem <spec>     # Simulate failures (error/rescue map, scope modes, prediction tracking)
/plan <goal>           # Decompose into trackable issues
```

**Output:** Beads issues with dependencies

### Implement Phase

```bash
/implement <issue>     # Single issue execution
/crank <epic>          # Autonomous epic loop (uses swarm for waves)
/swarm                 # Parallel execution (fresh context per agent)
```

**Output:** Code changes, tests, documentation

### Validate Phase

```bash
/vibe [target]         # Code validation (finding classification + suppression + domain checklists)
/post-mortem           # Validation + streak tracking + prediction accuracy + retro history
/retro                 # Quick-capture a single learning
```

**Output:** `.agents/learnings/`, `.agents/patterns/`

## Phase-to-Skill Mapping

| Phase | Primary Skill | Supporting Skills |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Discovery** | `/discovery` | `/brainstorm`, `/research`, `/plan`, `/pre-mortem` |
| **Implement** | `/crank` | `/implement` (single issue), `/swarm` (parallel execution) |
| **Validate** | `/validation` | `/vibe`, `/post-mortem`, `/retro`, `/forge` |

**Choosing the skill:**
- Use `/implement` for **single issue** execution. **Now defaults to TDD-first** — writes failing tests before implementing. Skip with `--no-tdd`.
- Use `/crank` for **autonomous epic execution** (loops waves via swarm until done). Auto-generates file-ownership maps to prevent worker conflicts.
- Use `/discovery` for the **discovery phase only** (brainstorm → search → research → plan → pre-mortem).
- Use `/validation` for the **validation phase only** (vibe → post-mortem → retro → forge).
- Use `/rpi` for **full lifecycle** — delegates to `/discovery` → `/crank` → `/validation`.
- Use `/ratchet` to **gate/record progress** through RPI.

## Knowledge Flywheel

Every `/post-mortem` promotes learnings and patterns into `.agents/` so future `/research` starts with better context instead of zero.

Inspect, lint, and triage the `.agents/` write surface contract via `ao agents inspect | lint | doctor` (`doctor` rolls up inspect + lint + orphan/stray-dir report; `--strict` fails on orphans).

## Runtime Modes

AgentOps has four runtime modes. Do not assume hook automation exists everywhere.

| Mode | When it applies | Start path | Closeout path | Guarantees |
|------|-----------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| `gc` | Gas City (`gc`) binary available and `city.toml` present | gc controller manages sessions; `ao rpi` auto-selects gc executor | gc event bus captures phase/gate/failure/metric events | Default when gc is available. Phase execution via gc sessions, events via gc event bus, agent health via gc health patrol |
| `hook-capable` | Claude/OpenCode with lifecycle hooks installed (no gc) | Runtime hook or `ao inject` / `ao lookup` | Runtime hook or `ao forge transcript` + `ao flywheel close-loop` | Automatic startup/context injection and session-end maintenance when hooks are installed |
| `codex-native-hooks` | Codex CLI v0.115.0+ with native hook support (March 2026) | Runtime hooks (same as hook-capable) | Runtime hooks (same as hook-capable) | Native lifecycle hooks — same guarantees as hook-capable mode |
| `codex-hookless-fallback` | Codex Desktop / Codex CLI pre-v0.115.0 without hook surfaces | `ao codex start` | `ao codex stop` | Explicit startup context, citation tracking, transcript fallback, and close-loop metrics without hooks |
| `manual` | No hooks and no Codex-native runtime detection | `ao inject` / `ao lookup` | `ao forge transcript` + `ao flywheel close-loop` | Works everywhere, but lifecycle actions are operator-driven |

## Issue Tracking

This workflow uses beads for git-native issue tracking:

```bash
bd ready              # Unblocked issues
bd show <id>          # Issue details
bd close <id>         # Close issue
bd vc status          # Inspect Dolt state if needed (JSONL auto-sync is automatic)
```

## Examples

**Startup context loading.** Hook-capable runtimes run `session-start.sh` at session start (`manual` mode auto-loads MEMORY.md and points to `ao search`/`ao lookup`; `lean` mode injects prior learnings on a reduced token budget). Codex v0.115.0+ fires hooks automatically; pre-v0.115.0 runs `ao codex start` / `ao codex stop` explicitly. Either way the agent gets the RPI workflow, prior context, and a citation path.

**Workflow reference during planning.** When a user asks how to approach a feature, the agent uses this skill's RPI section to recommend Research → Plan → Implement → Validate — `/research` for exploration, `/plan` for decomposition, `/pre-mortem` for failure simulation — instead of an ad-hoc approach.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Skill not auto-loaded | Hook runtime unavailable or startup path not run | Hook-capable runtimes: verify `hooks/session-start.sh` exists and is enabled. Codex: run `ao codex start` explicitly |
| Outdated skill catalog | This file not synced with actual skills/ directory | Update skill list in this file after adding/removing skills |
| Wrong skill suggested | Natural language trigger ambiguous | User explicitly calls skill with `/skill-name` syntax |
| Workflow unclear | RPI phases not well-documented here | Read full workflow guide in README.md or docs/ARCHITECTURE.md |
