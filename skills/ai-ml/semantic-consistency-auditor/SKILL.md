# Skill: Semantic Consistency Auditor

**ID:** 212  
**Name:** semantic-consistency-auditor  
**Description:** Introduces BERTScore and COMET algorithms to evaluate the semantic consistency between AI-generated clinical notes and expert gold standards from the "semantic entailment" level.

## Overview

Semantic Consistency Auditor is a medical AI evaluation tool used to assess the semantic consistency between AI-generated clinical notes and expert-written gold standards from a semantic level. This tool is not limited to traditional string matching or bag-of-words models, but uses deep learning models to understand semantic entailment relationships, capable of identifying expressions with different wording but similar meaning.

## Algorithms

### 1. BERTScore
BERTScore uses pre-trained BERT model contextual embeddings to calculate similarity between candidate text and reference text:
- **Precision**: How much semantics in the candidate text is covered by the reference text
- **Recall**: How much semantics in the reference text is covered by the candidate text
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall

### 2. COMET (Cross-lingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation)
COMET is a neural network-based evaluation metric originally used for machine translation evaluation, applicable to semantic entailment tasks:
- Uses XLM-RoBERTa encoder to capture deep semantics
- Outputs semantic consistency scores between 0-1
- Gives high scores to semantically equivalent but differently expressed text

## Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# Or venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install bertscore comet-ml transformers torch
```

## Configuration

Configure in `~/.openclaw/skills/semantic-consistency-auditor/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# BERTScore Configuration
bertscore:
  model: "microsoft/deberta-xlarge-mnli"  # Or "bert-base-chinese" for Chinese
  lang: "zh"  # Language code: zh, en, etc.
  rescale_with_baseline: true
  device: "auto"  # auto, cpu, cuda

# COMET Configuration
comet:
  model: "Unbabel/wmt22-comet-da"  # COMET model
  batch_size: 8
  device: "auto"

# Evaluation Thresholds
thresholds:
  bertscore_f1: 0.85
  comet_score: 0.75
  semantic_consistency: 0.80  # Comprehensive score threshold
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Evaluate single case pair
python scripts/main.py \
  --ai-generated "Patient presented with fever for 3 days, highest temperature 39°C, accompanied by cough." \
  --gold-standard "Patient chief complaint of fever for 3 days, highest temperature 39°C, accompanied by cough symptoms." \
  --output results.json

# Batch evaluation from JSON file
python scripts/main.py \
  --input-file batch_cases.json \
  --output results.json \
  --format detailed

# Use specific model
python scripts/main.py \
  --ai-generated "..." \
  --gold-standard "..." \
  --bert-model "bert-base-chinese" \
  --comet-model "Unbabel/wmt20-comet-da"
```

### Python API

```python
from semantic_consistency_auditor import SemanticConsistencyAuditor

# Initialize evaluator
auditor = SemanticConsistencyAuditor(
    bert_model="microsoft/deberta-xlarge-mnli",
    comet_model="Unbabel/wmt22-comet-da",
    lang="zh"
)

# Evaluate single case
result = auditor.evaluate(
    ai_text="Patient presented with fever for 3 days...",
    gold_text="Patient chief complaint of fever for 3 days..."
)

print(f"BERTScore F1: {result['bertscore']['f1']:.4f}")
print(f"COMET Score: {result['comet']['score']:.4f}")
print(f"Consistency: {result['consistency']:.4f}")
print(f"Passed: {result['passed']}")

# Batch evaluation
results = auditor.evaluate_batch([
    {"ai": "...", "gold": "..."},
    {"ai": "...", "gold": "..."}
])
```

## Input Format

### Single Case (Command Line)

Pass text directly through `--ai-generated` and `--gold-standard` parameters.

### Batch Evaluation File (JSON)

```json
[
  {
    "case_id": "CASE001",
    "ai_generated": "Patient presented with fever for 3 days, highest temperature 39°C, accompanied by cough.",
    "gold_standard": "Patient chief complaint of fever for 3 days, highest temperature 39°C, accompanied by cough symptoms.",
    "metadata": {
      "department": "Respiratory",
      "disease_type": "Upper respiratory infection"
    }
  },
  {
    "case_id": "CASE002",
    "ai_generated": "...",
    "gold_standard": "..."
  }
]
```

## Evaluation Criteria

### Semantic Consistency Grading

| Score Range | Grade | Description |
|---------|------|------|
| 0.90 - 1.00 | Excellent | Highly consistent semantics, almost no difference |
| 0.80 - 0.89 | Good | Basically consistent semantics, minor differences exist |
| 0.70 - 0.79 | Pass | Generally consistent semantics, partial omissions or deviations exist |
| 0.60 - 0.69 | Needs Improvement | Obvious semantic differences exist |
| < 0.60 | Fail | Semantic inconsistency, major omissions or errors exist |

### Pass Criteria

Default pass conditions (configurable):
- BERTScore F1 ≥ 0.85
- COMET Score ≥ 0.75
- Comprehensive semantic consistency ≥ 0.80

## Error Handling

| Error Code | Description | Handling Suggestion |
|-------|------|---------|
| E001 | Input text is empty | Check input data integrity |
| E002 | Model loading failed | Check network connection or local model path |
| E003 | Language not supported | Use supported lang parameter |
