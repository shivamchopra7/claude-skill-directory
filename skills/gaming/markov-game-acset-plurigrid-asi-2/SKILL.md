# markov-game-acset

Markov games as ACSets with derangement constraints on state transitions.

## Overview

Fills the "Markov games will be soon" gap from [open-games-engine Tutorial](https://github.com/CyberCat-Institute/open-game-engine).

**Origin**: PR #34 (closed, consolidated into main via #42)

## ACSet Schema

```julia
@present SchMarkovGame(FreeSchema) begin
    State::Ob
    Action::Ob
    Player::Ob
    Transition::Ob

    src_state::Hom(Transition, State)
    tgt_state::Hom(Transition, State)
    action::Hom(Transition, Action)
    player::Hom(Transition, Player)

    probability::Attr(Transition, Float64)
    reward::Attr(Transition, Float64)
end
```

## Derangement Constraint

**Key innovation**: No state can transition to itself.

```julia
# σ(s) ≠ s for all states s
is_derangement(mg::MarkovGame) = all(
    t -> src_state(mg, t) != tgt_state(mg, t),
    transitions(mg)
)
```

This ensures information MUST reflow between states.

## Stochastic Game Dynamics

```julia
function step!(game::MarkovGame, state::State, actions::Dict{Player,Action})
    valid_transitions = filter(transitions(game)) do t
        src_state(game, t) == state &&
        all(p -> action(game, t) == actions[p], players(game))
    end

    probs = [probability(game, t) for t in valid_transitions]
    chosen = sample(valid_transitions, Weights(probs))

    rewards = Dict(p => reward(game, chosen) for p in players(game))
    next_state = tgt_state(game, chosen)

    (next_state, rewards)
end
```
