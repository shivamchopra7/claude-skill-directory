## Examples

### Random number generation
```lua
-- Generate random numbers
local randomValue = love.math.random()  -- 0.0 to 1.0
local randomInt = love.math.random(1, 100)  -- 1 to 100
```

### Vector operations
```lua
-- Create and manipulate vectors
local vec1 = {x = 10, y = 20}
local vec2 = {x = 5, y = 15}

-- Vector addition
local result = {
  x = vec1.x + vec2.x,
  y = vec1.y + vec2.y
}
```

## Best practices
- Use love.math.random() with proper seeding for reproducibility
