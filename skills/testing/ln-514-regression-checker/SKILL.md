# Regression Checker

Runs the existing test suite to ensure no regressions after implementation changes.

## Purpose & Scope
- Detect test framework (pytest/jest/vitest/go test/etc.) and test dirs.
- Execute full suite; capture results for Story quality gate.
- Return PASS/FAIL with counts/log excerpts; never modifies Linear or kanban.

## When to Use
- **Invoked by ln-510-quality-coordinator** Phase 7
- Code quality check passed

## Workflow (concise)
1) Auto-discover test framework per `shared/references/ci_tool_detection.md` Command Registry (Test Frameworks section).
2) **Read `docs/project/runbook.md`** — get exact test commands, Docker setup, environment variables. Runbook commands take priority over auto-detection (per ci_tool_detection.md Discovery Hierarchy).
3) Build appropriate test command; run with timeout (5min per ci_tool_detection.md); capture stdout/stderr.
4) Parse results: passed/failed counts; key failing tests.
5) Output verdict JSON (PASS or FAIL + failures list) and add Linear comment.

## Critical Rules
- No selective test runs; run full suite.
- Do not fix tests or change status; only report.
- Language preservation in comment (EN/RU).

## Definition of Done
- Framework detected; command executed.
- Results parsed; verdict produced with failing tests (if any).
- Linear comment posted with summary.

## Reference Files
- Risk-based limits used downstream: `../shared/references/risk_based_testing_guide.md`
- **CI tool detection:** `shared/references/ci_tool_detection.md`
