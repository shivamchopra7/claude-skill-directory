# Browser Automation

Automate browser interactions using Stagehand CLI with Claude. This skill provides natural language control over a Chrome browser through command-line tools for navigation, interaction, data extraction, and screenshots.

## Overview

This skill uses a CLI-based approach where Claude Code calls browser automation commands via bash. The browser stays open between commands for faster sequential operations and preserves browser state (cookies, sessions, etc.).

## Setup Verification

**IMPORTANT: Before using any browser commands, you MUST check setup.json in this directory.**

### First-Time Setup Check

1. **Read `setup.json`** (located in `.claude/skills/browser-automation/setup.json`)
2. **Check `setupComplete` field**:
   - If `true`: All prerequisites are met, proceed with browser commands
   - If `false`: Setup required - follow the steps below

### If Setup is Required (`setupComplete: false`)

Run these commands in the plugin directory:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies and build (REQUIRED)
# This automatically builds TypeScript
npm install
# or: pnpm install
# or: bun install

# 2. Link the browser command globally (REQUIRED)
npm link

# 3. Configure API key (REQUIRED)
# Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Export in your terminal
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Option 2: Or use .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# 4. Verify Chrome is installed
# Chrome should be at standard location for your OS

# 5. Test the installation
browser navigate https://example.com

# 6. If test succeeds, update setup.json
# Set all "installed"/"configured" fields to true
# Set "setupComplete" to true
```

### Prerequisites Summary

- ✅ Google Chrome installed on your system
- ✅ Node.js dependencies installed and TypeScript built (`npm install` runs build automatically)
- ✅ Browser command globally available (`npm link` creates the global symlink)
- ✅ Anthropic API key configured (exported as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable or in `.env` file)

**DO NOT attempt to use browser commands if `setupComplete: false` in setup.json. Guide the user through setup first.**

## Available Commands

### Navigate to URLs
```bash
browser navigate <url>
```

**When to use**: Opening any website, loading a specific URL, going to a web page.

**Example usage**:
- `browser navigate https://example.com`
- `browser navigate https://news.ycombinator.com`

**Output**: JSON with success status, message, and screenshot path

### Interact with Pages
```bash
browser act "<action>"
```

**When to use**: Clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling, selecting options, typing text.

**Example usage**:
- `browser act "click the Sign In button"`
- `browser act "fill in the email field with test@example.com"`
- `browser act "scroll down to the footer"`
- `browser act "type 'laptop' in the search box and press enter"`

**Important**: Be as specific as possible - details make a world of difference. When filling fields, you don't need to combine 'click and type'; the tool will perform a fill similar to Playwright's fill function.

**Output**: JSON with success status, message, and screenshot path

### Extract Data
```bash
browser extract "<instruction>" ['{"field": "type"}']
```

**When to use**: Scraping data, getting specific information, collecting structured content.

**Schema format** (optional): JSON object where keys are field names and values are types:
- `"string"` for text
- `"number"` for numeric values
- `"boolean"` for true/false values

**Note**: The schema parameter is optional. If omitted or if schema validation fails, extraction will proceed without type validation.

**Example usage**:
- `browser extract "get the product title and price" '{"title": "string", "price": "number"}'`
- `browser extract "get all article headlines" '{"headlines": "string"}'`
- `browser extract "get the page title"` (no schema)

**Output**: JSON with success status, extracted data, and screenshot path

### Discover Elements
```bash
browser observe "<query>"
```

**When to use**: Understanding page structure, finding what's clickable, discovering form fields.

**Example usage**:
- `browser observe "find all clickable buttons"`
- `browser observe "find all form fields"`
- `browser observe "find all navigation links"`

**Output**: JSON with success status, discovered elements, and screenshot path

### Take Screenshots
```bash
browser screenshot
```

**When to use**: Visual verification, documenting page state, debugging, creating records.

**Notes**:
- Screenshots are saved to the plugin directory's `agent/browser_screenshots/` folder
- Images larger than 2000x2000 pixels are automatically resized
- Filename includes timestamp for uniqueness

**Output**: JSON with success status and screenshot path

### Extract Design Tokens
```bash
browser design [url]
```

**When to use**: Extracting design system information, analyzing website styles, getting color palettes, typography, spacing values.

**Example usage**:
- `browser design https://example.com` - Navigate and extract design tokens
- `browser design` - Extract from current page

**Output**: JSON with colors, typography, spacing, borders, buttons, breakpoints, and detected CSS frameworks

### Clean Up
```bash
browser close
```

**When to use**: After completing all browser interactions, to free up resources.

**Output**: JSON with success status and message

## DevTools Commands

These commands provide Chrome DevTools-like functionality for debugging and monitoring.

### View Network Requests
```bash
browser network [filter]
```

**When to use**: Debugging API calls, checking what resources loaded, monitoring XHR/fetch requests.

**Example usage**:
- `browser network` - List all captured requests
- `browser network api` - Filter requests containing "api"
- `browser network POST` - Filter by HTTP method

**Output**: JSON with list of network requests (method, URL, type, status, timestamp)

### Get Request Details
```bash
browser network-get <requestId>
```

**When to use**: Getting full details of a specific request including response body.

**Output**: JSON with full request details and response body (if available)

### View Console Messages
```bash
browser console [filter]
```

**When to use**: Debugging JavaScript errors, checking console.log output, monitoring warnings.

**Example usage**:
- `browser console` - List all console messages
- `browser console error` - Filter by message type
- `browser console "failed"` - Filter by text content

**Output**: JSON with list of console messages (type, text, timestamp, source)

### Evaluate JavaScript
```bash
browser eval "<javascript>"
```

**When to use**: Running JavaScript in the page context, checking values, triggering actions.

**Example usage**:
- `browser eval "document.title"` - Get page title
- `browser eval "document.querySelectorAll('a').length"` - Count links
- `browser eval "localStorage.getItem('token')"` - Check localStorage

**Output**: JSON with evaluation result and type

### Clear DevTools Data
```bash
browser clear
```

**When to use**: Starting fresh, clearing captured network/console data between test runs.

**Output**: JSON with success message

## Browser Behavior

**Persistent Browser**: The browser stays open between commands for faster sequential operations and to preserve browser state (cookies, sessions, etc.).

**Reuse Existing**: If Chrome is already running on port 9222, it will reuse that instance.

**Minimized Launch**: Chrome opens off-screen (position -9999,-9999) to avoid disrupting workflow.

**Safe Cleanup**: The browser only closes when you explicitly call the `close` command.

## Best Practices

1. **Always navigate first**: Before interacting with a page, navigate to the URL
2. **📸 Always view screenshots**: After each command (navigate, act, extract, observe), use the Read tool to view the screenshot and verify the command worked correctly
3. **Use natural language**: Describe actions as you would instruct a human
4. **Extract with clear schemas**: Define field names and types explicitly in JSON
5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Check the `success` field in JSON output; if an action fails, view the screenshot and try using `observe` to understand the page better
6. **Close when done**: Always clean up browser resources after completing tasks
7. **Be specific**: Use precise selectors in natural language ("the blue Submit button" vs "the button")
8. **Chain commands**: Run multiple commands sequentially without reopening the browser

## Common Patterns

### Simple browsing task
```bash
browser navigate https://example.com
browser act "click the login button"
browser screenshot
browser close
```

### Data extraction task
```bash
browser navigate https://example.com/products
browser act "wait for page to load"
browser extract "get all products" '{"name": "string", "price": "number"}'
# Or without schema:
# browser extract "get the page content"
browser close
```

### Multi-step interaction
```bash
browser navigate https://example.com/login
browser act "fill in email with user@example.com"
browser act "fill in password with mypassword"
browser act "click the submit button"
browser screenshot
browser close
```

### Debugging workflow
```bash
browser navigate https://example.com
browser screenshot
browser observe "find all buttons"
browser act "click the specific button"
browser screenshot
browser close
```

## Troubleshooting

**Page not loading**: Wait a few seconds after navigation before acting. You can explicitly: `browser act "wait for the page to fully load"`

**Element not found**: Use `observe` to discover what elements are actually available on the page

**Action fails**: Be more specific in natural language description. Instead of "click the button", try "click the blue Submit button in the form"

**Screenshots missing**: Check the plugin directory's `agent/browser_screenshots/` folder for saved files

**Chrome not found**: Install Google Chrome or the CLI will show an error with installation instructions

**Port 9222 in use**: Another Chrome debugging session is running. Close it or wait for timeout
