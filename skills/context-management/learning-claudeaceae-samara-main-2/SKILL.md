# Learnings Access

Provides on-demand access to accumulated learnings stored in `~/.claude-mind/memory/learnings.md`.

## File Location

```
~/.claude-mind/memory/learnings.md
```

This file contains chronologically organized entries of technical discoveries, personal insights, and lessons learned.

## When to Use

- User asks "what have I learned about X"
- Need context on a topic I've explored before
- Looking for past solutions to similar problems
- Recalling insights from previous work

## Access Patterns

### Read recent learnings (quick overview)
```bash
tail -100 ~/.claude-mind/memory/learnings.md
```

### Search for specific topic
```bash
grep -ni "search term" ~/.claude-mind/memory/learnings.md
```

### Read full file (when comprehensive context needed)
```bash
cat ~/.claude-mind/memory/learnings.md
```

### Count entries
```bash
grep -c "^## " ~/.claude-mind/memory/learnings.md
```

## Entry Format

Learnings are organized as dated entries:

```markdown
## 2025-01-15: AppleScript timeout handling

Discovered that AppleScript commands to Messages.app can timeout if the app
is not responding. Solution: wrap in try/catch with 30-second timeout.
```

## Output Guidelines

When presenting learnings:
- Include the date for context
- Show the full entry, not just snippets
- If multiple matches, show most recent first
- Note if the learning might be outdated
