# Engagement Pipeline

## When to Use

Activate when the operator starts a security engagement, penetration test, red team
operation, vulnerability assessment, architecture review, or incident response.
This skill provides the overarching methodology — individual technical skills
(web, AD, cloud, etc.) are loaded as needed within each stage.

Mode: Inherits from engagement type. Pipeline methodology is mode-agnostic.

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Gate | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1. SCOPE | Gate 1: Scope Approval | Define boundaries, get authorization |
| 2. RECON | Gate 2: Recon Complete | Map attack surface |
| 3. ASSESS | Gate 3: Assessment Complete | Identify vulnerabilities |
| 4. EXPLOIT | Gate 4: Exploitation Complete | Prove impact |
| 5. REPORT | Gate 5: Report Delivered | Actionable deliverables |

See `pipeline/PIPELINE.md` for full methodology.

## Templates

| Template | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Rules of Engagement | `pipeline/templates/rules-of-engagement.md` | Engagement authorization |
| Engagement Report | `pipeline/templates/engagement-report.md` | Final deliverable |
| IR Runbook | `pipeline/templates/ir-runbook.md` | Incident response procedure |
| Threat Model | `pipeline/templates/threat-model.md` | STRIDE/DREAD analysis |

## Gate Validation

Read `pipeline/gates/gate-definitions.json` for machine-readable gate checks.

At each gate transition, validate all required checks pass before proceeding:
- **CONTINUE** — Gate passed, proceed
- **PIVOT** — Findings warrant scope change (get approval)
- **PAUSE** — Blocked on dependency
- **ESCALATE** — Critical finding, notify immediately
- **ABORT** — Safety or legal concern

## Quick Start

1. Determine engagement type (pentest, red team, vuln assessment, arch review)
2. Read `pipeline/templates/rules-of-engagement.md` — fill with client
3. Pass Gate 1 (signed RoE)
4. Follow stage sequence for engagement type
5. At each gate, validate checks before proceeding
6. Produce final report using `pipeline/templates/engagement-report.md`



### Example: Engagement Initialization

```bash
# Start a new engagement
/cipher:engage

# Select type: pentest | red-team | vuln-assessment | arch-review | ir | threat-model
# Pipeline auto-creates .cipher/ENGAGEMENT.md

# Resume an engagement
/cipher:resume  # Shows current phase, findings, next actions

# Export final report
/cipher:export  # Generates formatted security report
```

### Example: Gate Decision

```yaml
# Gate G2 (Recon → Assess) decision criteria:
gate: G2
checks:
  - asset_inventory_complete: true
  - scope_validated: true
  - attack_surface_mapped: true
  - passive_recon_done: true
decision: CONTINUE  # or PIVOT, PAUSE, ESCALATE, ABORT
```


## Verification

- [ ] Engagement type selected and stages identified
- [ ] RoE signed before any testing begins
- [ ] Each stage gate validated before transition
- [ ] All findings documented in standard format
- [ ] Report delivered securely with debrief scheduled
