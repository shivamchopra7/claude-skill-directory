Check all project dependencies for issues.

## Steps

1. **Detect package manager**
   - package.json → npm/yarn/pnpm
   - requirements.txt / pyproject.toml → pip
   - go.mod → Go modules
   - Cargo.toml → Cargo
   - Gemfile → Bundler

2. **Check for outdated packages**
   ```
   npm outdated 2>/dev/null
   pip list --outdated 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **Check for vulnerabilities**
   ```
   npm audit 2>/dev/null
   pip audit 2>/dev/null
   ```

4. **Check for deprecated packages**
   - Read package.json/requirements.txt
   - Flag packages known to be deprecated or unmaintained

5. **Output report:**

   ```
