# Performing IoT Attack Simulation

## Overview

IoT attack simulation targets connected devices and operational technology
systems — from firmware extraction and analysis to protocol fuzzing, default
credential exploitation, and network segmentation bypass. These assessments
validate device hardening, network isolation controls, and detection
capabilities for IoT-specific attack patterns that traditional IT security
tools often miss.

## Prerequisites

| Tool / Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `python3` | Security tooling |
| `binwalk` | Security tooling |
| `firmwalker` | Security tooling |
| `boofuzz` | Security tooling |
| `protocol analyzers` | Security tooling |
| Authorized IoT assessment scope with device inventory | Environment requirement |
| Isolated test network segment for device interaction | Environment requirement |
| Safety review for OT/ICS device testing to prevent operational impact | Environment requirement |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Device Discovery and Enumeration

```bash
# Discover and fingerprint IoT devices on network segment
node scripts/agent.js discover --network 192.168.10.0/24 --output devices.json

# Enumerate device services and open ports
node scripts/agent.js enumerate --target 192.168.10.50 --deep
```

### Step 2: Firmware Analysis

```bash
# Extract and analyze device firmware
node scripts/agent.js firmware-extract --image firmware.bin --output extracted/

# Scan extracted firmware for credentials and vulnerabilities
node scripts/agent.js firmware-scan --path extracted/ --checks all
```

### Step 3: Protocol and Authentication Testing

```bash
# Fuzz IoT protocol implementation
node scripts/agent.js fuzz --target 192.168.10.50 --protocol mqtt --iterations 1000

# Test default and weak credentials
node scripts/agent.js cred-test --target 192.168.10.50 --wordlist iot-defaults.txt
```

### Step 4: Segmentation and Reporting

```bash
# Test network segmentation between IoT and corporate segments
node scripts/agent.js segmentation-test --source iot-vlan --target corp-vlan

# Generate IoT security assessment report
node scripts/agent.js report --scope full --output iot-report.json
```

## Detection
