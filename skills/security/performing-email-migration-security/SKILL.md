# Performing Email Migration Security

## Overview

Email migrations are high-risk windows where data protection controls may
lapse, authentication chains break, and encryption keys require careful
transfer. Security assessment before, during, and after migration ensures
continuity of email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), data-in-transit
protection, retention policy preservation, and access control integrity.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Admin access (source + target) | Audit configurations both sides |
| DNS management | Update MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC records |
| Migration tool access | Validate encryption in transit |
| Compliance documentation | Map retention and legal hold requirements |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Security Assessment

```python
from typing import Any

def pre_migration_checklist(source: str, target: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    checks = {
        "spf_record_documented": False,
        "dkim_keys_exported": False,
        "dmarc_policy_recorded": False,
        "retention_policies_mapped": False,
        "legal_holds_identified": False,
        "admin_accounts_audited": False,
        "mfa_enforced_target": False,
        "encryption_at_rest_target": False,
        "conditional_access_planned": False,
        "third_party_integrations_listed": False,
    }
    return {
        "source": source,
        "target": target,
        "checklist": checks,
        "status": "incomplete",
    }
```

### Step 2: Validate Data-in-Transit Protection

```bash
# Verify TLS on source SMTP
openssl s_client -connect mail.source.com:587 -starttls smtp 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -E "(Protocol|Cipher|Server certificate)"

# Verify TLS on target SMTP
openssl s_client -connect mail.target.com:587 -starttls smtp 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -E "(Protocol|Cipher|Server certificate)"

# Check migration tool uses encrypted channel
# Verify no plaintext IMAP (port 143) — only IMAPS (993)
nmap -p 143,993,587,465 mail.source.com --script ssl-enum-ciphers
```

### Step 3: DNS Cutover Security

```bash
# Document current records BEFORE cutover
dig MX example.com +short > pre_migration_mx.txt
dig TXT example.com +short | grep "v=spf1" > pre_migration_spf.txt
dig TXT _dmarc.example.com +short > pre_migration_dmarc.txt
dig TXT selector1._domainkey.example.com +short > pre_migration_dkim.txt

# Post-cutover — verify new records propagated
dig MX example.com +short
dig TXT example.com +short | grep "v=spf1"

# Lower DMARC to monitor during transition
# v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com; pct=100
# Then progressively enforce: none -> quarantine -> reject
```

### Step 4: Post-Migration Security Validation

```powershell
# Verify MFA enforcement on target tenant
Get-MgUser -All | Where-Object { $_.StrongAuthenticationMethods.Count -eq 0 } |
  Select-Object UserPrincipalName

# Verify retention policies migrated
Get-RetentionPolicy | Select-Object Name, RetentionPolicyTagLinks

# Verify no orphaned mailbox permissions
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Get-MailboxPermission |
  Where-Object { $_.User -ne "NT AUTHORITY\SELF" -and $_.IsInherited -eq $false }

# Verify conditional access policies active
Get-MgIdentityConditionalAccessPolicy | Select-Object DisplayName, State
```

## Detection Opportunities

| Signal | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Auth failures spike | Sign-in logs | Expected during cutover, investigate if prolonged |
| MX record change | DNS monitoring | Verify points to authorized target |
| Unencrypted migration | Network logs | Migration traffic on non-TLS ports |

## Verification

- [ ] Pre-migration DNS records documented and backed up
- [ ] TLS verified on source and target SMTP endpoints
- [ ] DKIM keys regenerated or transferred to target
- [ ] SPF updated to include target mail servers
- [ ] DMARC policy in monitor mode during transition
- [ ] MFA enforced on all target mailboxes
- [ ] Retention policies and legal holds preserved
- [ ] Post-migration authentication records enforce reject
