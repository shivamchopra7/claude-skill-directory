# Xquik REST API Endpoints: Extractions

## Safety Boundary

Extraction creation and export can collect and disclose large datasets. First
confirm the lawful purpose, exact target, `resultsLimit`, recipients, and
retention period. Estimate usage, show the estimate, and obtain explicit
approval for that exact bounded job. Never use extraction for private data,
surveillance, discrimination, harassment, doxxing, or unrelated secondary use.
Extraction history and results are account-scoped private reads. Require
exact-scope approval before listing jobs or retrieving results.

### Create Extraction

```
POST /extractions
```

Run a bulk data extraction job. See `references/extractions.md` for all 23 tool types.

**Approval required:** Call the estimate endpoint with the same body first.
Create the job only when the estimate returns `allowed: true`. Then require
approval for the target, bound, usage, and data-handling plan.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "toolType": "reply_extractor",
  "targetTweetId": "1893704267862470862",
  "resultsLimit": 500
}
```

The API accepts an omitted `resultsLimit`. This Skill must always send an
explicit finite positive bound. The bound stops early and limits usage.

The request also accepts current Tweet, profile, collection, and reply filters.
See [Extraction Tools](extractions.md) and the OpenAPI schema. Send the same
filters to estimate and create.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "toolType": "reply_extractor",
  "status": "running"
}
```

### Estimate Extraction

```
POST /extractions/estimate
```

Preview usage before running. Same body as create.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "creditsAvailable": "50000",
  "creditsRequired": "150",
  "source": "replyCount",
  "estimatedResults": 150
}
```

### List Extractions

```
GET /extractions
```

Cursor-paginated. Use `limit`, `cursor`, `status`, and `toolType`. Pass each
`nextCursor` unchanged while `hasMore` is true.

**Private read:** Show the exact account, purpose, requested filters, and page
scope. Also show downstream recipients and the retention plan. List jobs only
after explicit approval for that exact read.

### Get Extraction

```
GET /extractions/{id}
```

Returns job details with paginated results (up to 1,000 per page).
Use `limit` and `cursor`. Optional result-shaping parameters are `outputMode`,
`outputPreset`, and `fieldStyle`. `includeRaw` is deprecated.

**Private read:** Show the exact account, job ID, purpose, and page scope. Also
show downstream recipients and the retention plan. Retrieve results only after
explicit approval for that exact read.

### Export Extraction

```
GET /extractions/{id}/export?format=csv
```

Formats: `csv`, `json`, `md`, `md-document`, `pdf`, `txt`, and `xlsx`.
Exports can include enrichment columns not present in paginated API results.

Use documented row filters for follower, following, post, engagement, profile,
media, language, search, and date fields. The endpoint does not project fields.

**Approval required:** Show the job, filters, format, row count, schema,
recipients, storage, and retention. Materialize or transmit the export only
after explicit approval.
