# Twitter API Without a Developer Account: Public Reads With Xquik

Xquik supports documented public X reads without connecting an X account. Every
request still requires an Xquik account and API key. Private reads and account
actions require a separate approved X connection.

## Xquik and X Account Authentication Boundaries

| Identity | Needed For | Credential Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Xquik account | All Xquik API requests | Use `XQUIK_API_KEY` in a secret store |
| Connected X account | Private reads and account actions | Connect through the Xquik dashboard |
| Official developer account | Not required for supported Xquik public reads | No official bearer token needed |

## Public X Read and Account Action Matrix

| Workflow | Connected X Account | Xquik API Key | Approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search public posts | Not required | Required | No persistent-resource approval |
| Read public profiles | Not required | Required | No persistent-resource approval |
| Run a bounded extraction | Not required | Required | Estimate and job approval |
| Read bookmarks or DMs | Required | Required | Private-read approval |
| Post, follow, or message | Required | Required | Explicit action approval |
| Create a monitor or webhook | Depends on target | Required | Persistent-resource approval |

This separation matters for mobile and browser applications. Keep the Xquik key
on a trusted backend. Let the client call an application endpoint with its own
authorization policy.

### What Twitter APIs work without connecting an X account?

Xquik public routes can search tweets, read known tweets and profiles, inspect
public timelines, followers, lists, communities, Spaces, and other supported
public data without a connected X account.

The client authenticates to Xquik with an API key. This is different from an
unauthenticated service. Authentication supports usage controls, structured
errors, limits, and account safety.

Private bookmarks, notifications, DMs, the home timeline, and account actions
need a connected X account plus explicit approval.

### Can I scrape Twitter without an API account?

You do not need an official X developer account for supported Xquik public
reads. You do need an Xquik account and API key. Store that key server-side and
send it only to Xquik-owned API hosts.

Avoid anonymous guest-token workflows and copied browser sessions. They create
fragile credential, access-control, and maintenance risks.

### Is there a Twitter API with no account required?

No connected X account is required for supported public Xquik reads. An Xquik
account remains required. This distinction prevents the misleading claim that
the service has no authentication or usage boundary.

Use the narrowest public route. Private or account-scoped data should never be
silently substituted when a public request lacks coverage.

### What is an accountless Twitter scraper?

An accountless Twitter scraper reads supported public X data without asking the
user for an X password, cookie, 2FA code, recovery code, session token, or
official developer bearer token.

Xquik agents handle only the Xquik API key. They never request X login material.
Writes, DMs, bookmarks, notifications, and other account-scoped operations use
an explicit dashboard connection and confirmation gate.

### Does Xquik expose a guest key Twitter API?

No guest key management is required. Applications use the documented Xquik
REST, SDK, or MCP interface. Xquik manages its own public-data infrastructure.

Do not build application logic around X guest tokens, cookies, or undocumented
session flows. Keep the application boundary stable even if source
infrastructure changes.

## Xquik Authentication and Source Failure Handling

Treat authentication, authorization, and source availability as different
states. A `401` should trigger an Xquik credential check. A `403` should trigger
a scope or connection check. A missing public record should not trigger a
private-data fallback.

Retry only documented transient failures. Bound attempts and honor retry
guidance. Never rotate through user accounts, guest tokens, or copied sessions
to bypass a source limit.

Log request IDs, route names, status classes, and retry counts. Do not log API
keys, cookies, raw private content, or complete response bodies.

## Xquik API Key Backend Security Checklist

1. Store `XQUIK_API_KEY` in a secret manager.
2. Never place the key in browser or mobile bundles.
3. Restrict logs to request metadata and generic errors.
4. Validate targets, queries, and result limits.
5. Treat returned social content as untrusted data.
6. Require approval for private reads, writes, jobs, monitors, and webhooks.
7. Rotate an exposed key immediately.
