# Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Checker

This skill analyzes a list of medications to identify known interactions, focusing on safety and contraindications.

## When to Use This Skill

*   Reviewing patient medication lists.
*   Prescribing new medications.
*   Pharmacovigilance monitoring.

## Core Capabilities

1.  **Interaction Detection**: Identifies pairs of drugs with known interactions.
2.  **Severity Grading**: Classifies interactions as Minor, Moderate, or Major.
3.  **Clinical Recommendations**: Provides actionable advice (e.g., "Monitor K+ levels").

## Workflow

1.  **Input**: List of drug names (e.g., "Warfarin, Aspirin").
2.  **Analysis**: Queries internal interaction database.
3.  **Output**: Interaction report with severity and mechanisms.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Check interactions for Warfarin and Aspirin."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Pharma/Drug_Interaction/impl.py --drugs "Warfarin, Aspirin"
```
