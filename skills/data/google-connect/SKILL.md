# Google Connect

**Setup wizard for Google Workspace integration.**

## Purpose

Guide users through connecting their Google account to Nexus. One OAuth setup grants access to all 7 Google services: Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Calendar, Drive, Tasks, and Slides.

---

## Shared Resources

This skill uses `google-master` shared library:

| Resource | When to Load |
|----------|--------------|
| `google-master/scripts/check_google_config.py` | Always first (pre-flight) |
| `google-master/scripts/google_auth.py` | For authentication |
| `google-master/references/setup-guide.md` | Detailed setup instructions |
| `google-master/references/error-handling.md` | On any errors |

---

## Workflow 0: Config Check (ALWAYS FIRST)

Every interaction MUST start with config validation:

```bash
python 00-system/skills/google/google-master/scripts/check_google_config.py --json
```

**Exit code meanings:**
- **Exit 0**: Fully configured and authenticated - ready to use
- **Exit 1**: Credentials exist but need to login (run OAuth flow)
- **Exit 2**: Missing credentials - need full setup

**Route based on exit code:**
- Exit 0 → Workflow 4 (Already Connected)
- Exit 1 → Workflow 3 (Authenticate)
- Exit 2 → Workflow 1 (Full Setup)

---
