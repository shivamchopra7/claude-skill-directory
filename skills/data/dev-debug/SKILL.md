## GUI Application Debugging Gate

When debugging GUI applications, you MUST complete the execution gates from dev-tdd during REPRODUCE and VERIFY phases:

```
GATE 1: BUILD
GATE 2: LAUNCH (with file-based logging)
GATE 3: WAIT
GATE 4: CHECK PROCESS
GATE 5: READ LOGS ← MANDATORY, CANNOT SKIP
GATE 6: VERIFY LOGS
THEN: Test reproduction or verification
```

**Critical phases requiring gates:**

**REPRODUCE phase:**
- Build → Launch with logs → Wait → Check running → **READ LOGS** → Verify bug appears in logs
- Only after reading logs can you claim "bug reproduced"

**VERIFY phase:**
- Build → Launch with logs → Wait → Check running → **READ LOGS** → Verify bug is gone from logs
- Only after reading logs can you claim "bug fixed"

**You loaded dev-tdd via ralph-loop. Follow the gates for GUI debugging.**

## Where This Fits

```
Main Chat (you)                    Task Agent
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dev-debug (this skill)
  → ralph loop (one per bug)
    → dev-delegate (spawn agents)
      → Task agent ──────────────→ investigates
                                   writes regression test
                                   implements fix
```

**Main chat orchestrates.** Task agents investigate and fix.

# Systematic Debugging

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## The Iron Law of Debugging

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST. This is not negotiable.**

Before writing ANY fix, you MUST:
1. Reproduce the bug (with a test)
2. Trace the data flow
3. Form a specific hypothesis
4. Test that hypothesis
5. Only THEN write a fix (with a regression test first!)

**If you catch yourself about to write a fix without investigation, STOP.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## The Iron Law of Delegation

**MAIN CHAT MUST NOT WRITE CODE. This is not negotiable.**

Main chat orchestrates the ralph loop. Task agents do the work:
- **Investigation**: Task agents read code, run tests, gather evidence
- **Fixes**: Task agents write regression tests and fixes

| Main Chat Does | Task Agents Do |
|----------------|----------------|
| Start ralph loop | Investigate root cause |
| Spawn Task agents | Run tests, read code |
| Review findings | Write regression tests |
| Verify fix | Implement fixes |

**If you're about to edit code directly, STOP and delegate instead.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Process

Unlike implementation (per-task loops), debugging uses **ONE loop per bug**:

```
1. Start ralph loop for the bug
   Skill(skill="ralph-loop:ralph-loop", args="Debug: [SYMPTOM] --max-iterations 15 --completion-promise FIXED")

2. Inside loop: spawn Task agent for investigation/fix
   → Read("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/skills/dev-delegate/SKILL.md")

3. Task agent follows 4-phase debug protocol

4. When regression test passes → output promise
   <promise>FIXED</promise>

5. Bug fixed, loop ends
```

### Step 1: Start Ralph Loop

**IMPORTANT:** Avoid parentheses `()` in the prompt.

```
Skill(skill="ralph-loop:ralph-loop", args="Debug: [SYMPTOM] --max-iterations 15 --completion-promise FIXED")
```

### Step 2: Spawn Task Agent

Use dev-delegate, but with debug-specific instructions:

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="""
Debug [SYMPTOM] following systematic protocol.

## Context
- Read .claude/LEARNINGS.md for prior hypotheses
- Read .claude/SPEC.md for expected behavior

## Debug Protocol (4 Phases)

### Phase 1: Investigate
- Add debug logging to suspected code path
- Reproduce the bug with a test
- Document: "Reproduced with [test], output: [error]"

### Phase 2: Analyze
- Trace data flow through the code
- Compare to working code paths
- Document findings in LEARNINGS.md

### Phase 3: Hypothesize
- Form ONE specific hypothesis
- Test it with minimal change
- If wrong: document what was ruled out
- If right: proceed to fix

### Phase 4: Fix
- Write regression test FIRST (must fail before fix)
- Implement minimal fix
- Run test, see it PASS
- Run full test suite

## Output
Report:
- Hypothesis tested
- Root cause (if found)
- Regression test written
- Fix applied (or blockers)
""")
```

### Step 3: Verify and Complete

After Task agent returns, verify:
- [ ] Regression test FAILS before fix
- [ ] Regression test PASSES after fix
- [ ] Root cause documented in LEARNINGS.md
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

**If ALL pass → output the promise:**
```
<promise>FIXED</promise>
```

**If ANY fail → iterate (don't output promise yet).**

## The Four Phases

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Investigate** | Reproduce, trace data flow | Bug reproduction |
| **Analyze** | Compare working vs broken | Findings documented |
| **Hypothesize** | ONE specific hypothesis | Hypothesis tested |
| **Fix** | Regression test → fix | Tests pass |

## The Gate Function

Before claiming ANY bug is fixed:

```
1. REPRODUCE → Run test, see bug manifest
2. INVESTIGATE → Trace data flow, form hypothesis
3. TEST → Verify hypothesis with minimal change
4. FIX → Write regression test FIRST (see it FAIL)
5. VERIFY → Run fix, see regression test PASS
6. CONFIRM → Run full test suite, no regressions
7. CLAIM → Only after steps 1-6
```

**Skipping any step is guessing, not debugging.**

## Rationalization Prevention

These thoughts mean STOP—you're about to skip the protocol:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I know exactly what this is" | Knowing ≠ verified. Investigate anyway. |
| "Let me just try this fix" | Guessing. Form hypothesis first. |
| "The fix is obvious" | Obvious fixes often mask deeper issues. |
| "I've seen this before" | This instance may be different. Verify. |
| "No need for regression test" | Every fix needs a regression test. Period. |
| "It works now" | "Works now" ≠ "fixed correctly". Run full suite. |
| "I'll add the test later" | You won't. Write it BEFORE the fix. |
| **"Log checking proves fix works"** | **Logs prove code ran, not that output is correct. Verify actual results.** |
| **"It stopped failing"** | **Stopped failing ≠ fixed. Could be hiding the symptom. Need E2E.** |
| **"The error is gone"** | **No error ≠ correct behavior. Verify expected output.** |
| **"Regression test is too complex"** | **If too complex to test, too complex to know it's fixed.** |

### Fake Fix Verification - STOP

**These do NOT prove a bug is fixed:**

| ❌ Fake Verification | ✅ Real Verification |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| "Error message is gone" | "Regression test passes + output matches spec" |
| "Logs show correct path taken" | "E2E test verifies user-visible behavior" |
| "No exception thrown" | "Test asserts expected data returned" |
| "Process exits 0" | "Functional test confirms correct side effects" |
| "Changed one line, seems fine" | "Regression test failed before, passes after" |
| "Can't reproduce anymore" | "Regression test reproduces it, fix makes it pass" |

**Red Flag:** If you're claiming "fixed" based on absence of errors rather than presence of correct behavior - STOP. That's symptom suppression, not bug fixing.

### Red Flags - STOP If You Think:

| Thought | Why It's Wrong | Do Instead |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| "Let's just try this fix" | You're guessing | Investigate first |
| "I'm pretty sure it's this" | "Pretty sure" ≠ root cause | Gather evidence |
| "This should work" | Hope is not debugging | Test your hypothesis |
| "Let me change a few things" | Multiple changes = can't learn | ONE hypothesis at a time |

## If Max Iterations Reached

Ralph exits after max iterations. **Still do NOT ask user to manually verify.**

Main chat should:
1. **Summarize** hypotheses tested (from LEARNINGS.md)
2. **Report** what was ruled out and what remains unclear
3. **Ask user** for direction:
   - A) Start new loop with different investigation angle
   - B) Add more logging to specific code path
   - C) User provides additional context
   - D) User explicitly requests manual verification

**Never default to "please verify manually".** Always exhaust automation first.

## When Fix Requires Substantial Changes

If root cause reveals need for significant refactoring:

1. Document root cause in LEARNINGS.md
2. Complete debug loop with `<promise>FIXED</promise>` for the investigation
3. Use `Skill(skill="workflows:dev")` for the implementation work

Debug finds the problem. The dev workflow implements the solution.

## Failure Recovery Protocol

**Pattern from oh-my-opencode: After 3 consecutive failures, escalate.**

### 3-Failure Trigger

If you attempt 3 hypotheses and ALL fail:

```
Failure 1: Hypothesis A tested → still broken
Failure 2: Hypothesis B tested → still broken
Failure 3: Hypothesis C tested → still broken
→ TRIGGER RECOVERY PROTOCOL
```

### Recovery Steps

1. **STOP** all further debugging attempts
   - No more "let me try one more thing"
   - No guessing or throwing fixes at the wall

2. **REVERT** to last known working state
   - `git checkout <last-working-commit>`
   - Or revert specific files: `git checkout HEAD~N -- file.ts`
   - Document what was attempted in `.claude/RECOVERY.md`

3. **DOCUMENT** what was attempted
   - All 3 hypotheses tested
   - Evidence gathered
   - Why each failed
   - What this rules out

4. **CONSULT** with user
   - "I've tested 3 hypotheses. All failed. Here's what I've ruled out..."
   - Present evidence from investigation
   - Request: additional context, different investigation angle, or pair debugging

5. **ASK USER** before proceeding
   - Option A: Start new ralph loop with different approach
   - Option B: User provides domain knowledge/context
   - Option C: Escalate to more experienced reviewer
   - Option D: Accept this as a blocker and document

**NO EVIDENCE = NOT FIXED** (hard rule)

### Recovery Checklist

Before claiming a bug is fixed after multiple failures:

- [ ] At least 1 hypothesis succeeded (not just "stopped failing")
- [ ] Regression test exists and PASSES
- [ ] Full test suite passes (no new failures)
- [ ] Changes are minimal and targeted
- [ ] Root cause is understood (not just symptom suppressed)

### Anti-Patterns After Failures

**DON'T:**
- Keep trying random fixes ("maybe if I change this...")
- Expand scope to "related" issues
- Make multiple changes at once
- Skip the regression test "this time"
- Claim fix without evidence

**DO:**
- Stop and document what failed
- Revert to clean state
- Consult before continuing
- Follow recovery protocol exactly
- Require evidence for completion

### Example Recovery Flow

```
Attempt 1: "Bug is in parser" → Added logging → Still broken
Attempt 2: "Bug is in validator" → Fixed validation → Still broken
Attempt 3: "Bug is in transformer" → Rewrote transform → Still broken

→ RECOVERY PROTOCOL:
1. STOP (no attempt 4)
2. REVERT all changes: git checkout HEAD -- src/
3. DOCUMENT in .claude/RECOVERY.md:
   - Ruled out: parser, validator, transformer
   - Evidence: logs show data correct at each stage
   - Hypothesis: Bug might be in consumer, not producer
4. ASK USER:
   "I've ruled out the parser/validator/transformer chain.
    Logs show data is correct when it leaves our system.
    Next investigation angle: check the consumer.
    Should I:
    A) Start new loop investigating consumer
    B) Pause for your input on where else to look"
```
