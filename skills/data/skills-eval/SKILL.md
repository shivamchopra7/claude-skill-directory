## Overview

This framework audits Claude skills against quality standards to improve performance and reduce token consumption. Automated tools analyze skill structure, measure context usage, and identify specific technical improvements.

The `skills-auditor` provides structural analysis, while the `improvement-suggester` ranks fixes by impact. Compliance is verified through the `compliance-checker`. Runtime efficiency is monitored by `tool-performance-analyzer` and `token-usage-tracker`.

## Quick Start

### Basic Audit
Run a full audit of all skills or target a specific file to identify structural issues.
```bash
# Audit all skills
make audit-all

# Audit specific skill
make audit-skill TARGET=path/to/skill/SKILL.md
```

### Analysis and Optimization
Use `skill_analyzer.py` for complexity checks and `token_estimator.py` to verify the context budget.
```bash
make analyze-skill TARGET=path/to/skill/SKILL.md
make estimate-tokens TARGET=path/to/skill/SKILL.md
```

### Improvements
Generate a prioritized plan and verify standards compliance using `improvement_suggester.py` and `compliance_checker.py`.
```bash
make improve-skill TARGET=path/to/skill/SKILL.md
make check-compliance TARGET=path/to/skill/SKILL.md
```

## Evaluation Workflow

Start with `make audit-all` to inventory skills and identify high-priority targets. For each skill requiring attention, run analysis with `analyze-skill` to map complexity. Generate an improvement plan, apply fixes, and run `check-compliance` to verify the skill meets project standards. Finalize by checking the token budget for efficiency.

## Evaluation and Optimization

Quality assessments use the `skills-auditor` and `improvement-suggester` to generate detailed reports. Performance analysis focuses on token efficiency through the `token-usage-tracker` and tool performance via `tool-performance-analyzer`. For standards compliance, the `compliance-checker` automates common fixes for structural issues.

### Scoring and Prioritization

We evaluate skills across five dimensions: structure compliance, content quality, token efficiency, activation reliability, and tool integration. Scores above 90 represent production-ready skills, while scores below 50 indicate critical issues requiring immediate attention.

Improvements are prioritized by impact. Critical issues include security vulnerabilities or broken functionality. High-priority items cover structural flaws that hinder discoverability. Medium and low priorities focus on best practices and minor optimizations.
