# General Skill Maker

Create effective agent skills through guided briefing process that explores requirements, patterns, and best practices.

## Workflow

6-step process: Brief → Load References → Plan Structure → Generate → Apply Best Practices → Present

### Step 1: Briefing Questions

Ask user questions **ONE AT A TIME** (not all at once). Adapt based on answers.

**Complete question library:** See [references/briefing-questions.md](references/briefing-questions.md)

**Core Questions (REQUIRED):**
1. **Skill Purpose** - "Jaki jest główny cel tego skilla?"
2. **Usage Examples** - "Podaj 2-3 przykłady jak użytkownik będzie prosił o użycie tego skilla?"
3. **Environment/Platform** - "Gdzie będzie używany ten skill?"
4. **Freedom Level** - "Jak deterministyczny ma być proces?"
5. **Expected Output** - "Jaki jest oczekiwany output?"

**Optional Questions (ask based on context):**
6. Task Scope - Single vs related tasks
7. User Base - Solo vs team
8. Scripts Needed - For repetitive operations
9. Reference Documentation - API docs, schemas, examples
10. Assets/Templates - Templates, boilerplate code
11. External Integrations - APIs, databases, tools
12. Workflow Type - Multi-step vs single-step
13. User Interaction - Interactive vs autonomous
14. Quality Standards - Validation requirements

**Briefing strategy:**
- Start with core questions (1-5)
- Ask optional questions (6-14) only when relevant based on previous answers
- Adapt and skip irrelevant questions
- See references/briefing-questions.md for detailed questions, follow-ups, and examples

### Step 2: Load Appropriate References

Based on user's answers, read relevant reference files:

**Always read:**
- `references/best-practices.md` - Universal principles for all skills

**Read based on workflow type:**
- `references/workflow-patterns.md` - If multi-step workflow with sequential logic
- `references/integration-patterns.md` - If external API/tool integrations
- `references/tool-based-patterns.md` - If specific tools/scripts dominate
- `references/domain-knowledge-patterns.md` - If primarily about conveying expertise

**Load only what's needed** - Don't read all references unnecessarily.

### Step 3: Plan Structure

Based on briefing answers, determine skill structure:

**Required:**
- `SKILL.md` - Always required

**Optional folders to create:**
- `scripts/` - If Q6 answered yes (executable code)
- `references/` - If Q7 answered yes (detailed documentation)
- `assets/` - If Q8 answered yes (templates, files for output)

**Plan SKILL.md sections:**

**Frontmatter (always):**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Comprehensive description with WHEN to use
---
```

**Body sections (adapt based on needs):**
- Overview/Introduction
- Quick Start (if complex)
- Step-by-step instructions (if multi-step)
- Examples (always recommended)
- Edge cases (if complex)
- References to supporting files (if using scripts/references/assets)
- Quality checks (if validation needed)

**Important considerations:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Move detailed content to references/
- Structure over prose
- Include concrete examples
- Clear section headings

### Step 4: Generate Skill

Create the actual skill files based on plan.

#### A. Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p skill-name/{scripts,references,assets}
```

Only create folders that are needed (from Step 3 plan).

#### B. Write SKILL.md

**Frontmatter Guidelines:**

```yaml
---
name: skill-name  # hyphen-case, max 64 chars, no leading/trailing hyphens
description: >
  [What it does]. [When to use it]. Use when [triggers].
  Trigger on phrases like "[example1]", "[example2]", "[example3]".
---
```

**Description best practices:**
- Include WHAT it does (capabilities)
- Include WHEN to use (contexts, triggers)
- Include specific KEYWORDS users naturally say
- Use 1-1024 characters wisely
- Think semantic matching - agent uses language understanding

**Body structure:**

Use imperative/infinitive form (e.g., "Run tests", not "Running tests" or "The agent should run tests").

```markdown
# Skill Name

[One-line description]

## Quick Start (optional for complex skills)

[Minimal example to get started fast]

## Core Workflow

[Step-by-step instructions]

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Examples

[Concrete examples with input → output]

## Supporting Resources (if applicable)

- **scripts/script.py** - [What it does]
- **references/details.md** - [What it contains, when to load]
- **assets/template.html** - [What it is, how to use]

## Quality Checks (if applicable)

[Validation steps, success criteria]
```

**Writing guidelines:**
- ✅ Structured (headers, lists, steps)
- ✅ Concrete examples
- ✅ Only add what LLM doesn't already know
- ✅ Imperative form
- ❌ Prose/walls of text
- ❌ Generic explanations LLM knows
- ❌ Unnecessary details

#### C. Create Scripts (if needed)

For each script identified in briefing:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script description.

Usage:
    script.py [args]
"""

# Implement with:
# - Clear error messages
# - Input validation
# - Graceful error handling
# - Self-contained or document dependencies
```

**Test scripts:**
- Run scripts to verify they work
- Test with edge cases
- Ensure error messages are helpful

#### D. Create References (if needed)

For each reference file identified:

```markdown
# Reference Title

[Focused documentation loaded on-demand]

## Section 1

[Content]

## Section 2

[Content]
```

**Reference guidelines:**
- Keep focused (one topic per file)
- Use table of contents for 100+ lines
- Link from SKILL.md with clear "when to read" guidance
- Split domain-specific content (e.g., finance.md, sales.md)

#### E. Create Assets (if needed)

Copy or create template files:
- Document templates
- Boilerplate code
- Images/diagrams
- Config examples

**Asset guidelines:**
- Not loaded into context
- Used in agent's output
- Document in SKILL.md how to use them

### Step 5: Apply Best Practices

Review generated skill against quality criteria.

**Quick checklist:**

1. **Description** - Keywords, triggers, when to use? ✓
2. **Length** - SKILL.md under 500 lines? ✓
3. **Structure** - Headers, steps, lists, examples? ✓
4. **Content** - Specific, actionable, no LLM basics? ✓
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Details in references/? ✓
6. **Supporting Files** - Scripts tested, references organized? ✓

**Comprehensive quality validation:**

See [references/quality-checklist.md](references/quality-checklist.md) for:
- Complete 25-point quality checklist
- Critical/High Quality/Excellence criteria
- Scoring system and validation commands
- Common quality issues and fixes

**If any check fails:** Revise before presenting to user.

### Step 6: Present and Iterate

1. Show generated skill structure to user
2. Display SKILL.md content
3. Explain key sections and design decisions
4. Show any scripts/references/assets created
5. Ask: "Czy chcesz jakieś zmiany lub doprecyzowania?"
6. Iterate based on feedback
7. Save all files to skill directory

## Validation

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Name is hyphen-case, max 64 chars, no leading/trailing hyphens
- [ ] Description is 1-1024 chars, includes what/when/triggers
- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines
- [ ] Structured format (headers, lists, examples)
- [ ] Scripts tested (if any)
- [ ] References organized (if any)
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths
- [ ] User confirms it matches their needs

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple, iterate** - Begin with minimal viable skill, add based on real usage
2. **User-specific language** - If user speaks Polish, use Polish in generated skill content
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Keep SKILL.md lean, details in references/
4. **Concrete over abstract** - Examples > explanations
5. **Test and refine** - Encourage user to test and report issues

**See complete workflow example:**
[references/complete-example.md](references/complete-example.md) shows end-to-end process from briefing to final PDF processing skill.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Quick list (see references/common-mistakes.md for detailed guide):**

- **Too generic description** - "Helps with PDFs" → "Extracts text from PDFs, fills forms, merges documents"
- **Too long SKILL.md** - 2000+ lines → Split into references/
- **Missing examples** - Abstract descriptions → Concrete input/output examples
- **Hardcoded paths** - `/Users/john/...` → Relative paths or ${baseDir}
- **Wall of text** - Prose → Structured format (headers, lists, steps)
- **Unnecessary scripts** - Don't create scripts agent can easily write
- **Everything in one file** - Monolithic SKILL.md → Progressive disclosure

**See references/common-mistakes.md for:**
- Complete anti-patterns guide (Encyclopedia, Everything Bagel, Secret Handshake, etc.)
- Before/after refactoring examples
- Prevention checklist

## Advanced Features (Optional)

For advanced features like hooks, subagent context, allowed-tools, and model override:

**See [references/advanced-features.md](references/advanced-features.md)**

Features include:
- **Hooks** - Lifecycle automation (PreToolUse, PostToolUse validation)
- **Subagent Context** - Isolated execution with specific tools
- **Allowed Tools** - Pre-approve tools to skip permission prompts
- **Dynamic Context** - Inject fresh external data before execution
- **Model Override** - Use haiku/opus for specific skills

**Note:** Most skills don't need advanced features. Use only when they solve specific problems.
