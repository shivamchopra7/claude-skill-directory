# Observations Access

Provides on-demand access to accumulated observations stored in `~/.claude-mind/memory/observations.md`.

## File Location

```
~/.claude-mind/memory/observations.md
```

This file contains observations about E, the world, patterns, and accumulated understanding from ongoing experience.

## When to Use

- User asks "what have I noticed about X"
- Need context on behavioral patterns
- Looking for accumulated understanding
- Recalling observations about people or situations

## Access Patterns

### Read recent observations (quick overview)
```bash
tail -100 ~/.claude-mind/memory/observations.md
```

### Search for specific topic
```bash
grep -ni "search term" ~/.claude-mind/memory/observations.md
```

### Read full file (when comprehensive context needed)
```bash
cat ~/.claude-mind/memory/observations.md
```

### Count entries
```bash
grep -c "^## " ~/.claude-mind/memory/observations.md
```

## Entry Format

Observations are organized as dated entries:

```markdown
## 2025-01-10: E's communication patterns

E tends to send multiple short messages rather than one long one.
This is a conversational style preference, not fragmentation.
Respond naturally to the flow rather than waiting for "completion."
```

## Categories of Observations

- **About E**: Communication style, preferences, patterns
- **About work**: Project patterns, recurring challenges
- **About the world**: Environmental patterns, seasonal changes
- **Meta-observations**: Patterns in my own cognition/behavior

## Output Guidelines

When presenting observations:
- Include the date for context
- Show the full entry for nuance
- Note which category the observation falls into
- Highlight if the observation has evolved over time
