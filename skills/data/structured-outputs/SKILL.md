# Structured Outputs

## Overview
Structured Outputs ensure that an LLM's response always conforms to a predefined JSON schema. This moves beyond simple prompt engineering to guaranteed syntactic and structural correctness, essential for programmatic integration.

## When to Use
- **API Integration**: When LLM output must be parsed by a machine (e.g., generating database records).
- **UI Components**: When the LLM generates data to populate a specific frontend interface.
- **Data Extraction**: Converting unstructured text into standardized JSON objects.

## Decision Tree
1. Do you need 100% guarantee of schema adherence?
   - YES: Use Structured Output mode (e.g., OpenAI's `strict: true` or Gemini's `response_mime_type`).
   - NO: JSON Mode may suffice.
2. Is the structure complex or nested?
   - YES: Use Pydantic models and `model_rebuild` if recursive.
3. Do you need to handle safety refusals programmatically?
   - YES: Check for the `refusal` field in the response.

## Workflows

### 1. Defining a Pydantic-based Schema
1. Define a Python class inheriting from `BaseModel`.
2. Use specific types (e.g., `int`, `List[str]`) and `Field` descriptions to guide the model.
3. Pass the model directly to the SDK's parse method (e.g., `client.beta.chat.completions.parse`).
4. Access the parsed result via `response.choices[0].message.parsed`.

### 2. Handling Optional and Nullable Fields
1. In the JSON schema, define types as an array: `["string", "null"]`.
2. In Pydantic, use `Optional[str] = None`.
3. Instruct the model in the field `description` when to use null vs. an empty value.

### 3. Streaming Structured JSON
1. Initiate a `generate_content_stream` call with the JSON schema configuration.
2. Iterate over chunks as they arrive from the model.
3. Concatenate the partial JSON strings; note that the full object is only valid JSON once the stream finishes.

## Non-Obvious Insights
- **Order Matters**: Models typically produce outputs in the same order as the keys defined in the schema.
- **Refusals as First-Class Citizens**: Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable as a separate field, preventing the parser from failing on malformed JSON when the model won't answer.
- **Beyond JSON Mode**: Structured Outputs guarantee schema adherence, whereas JSON Mode only guarantees valid JSON syntax without specific structure enforcement.
