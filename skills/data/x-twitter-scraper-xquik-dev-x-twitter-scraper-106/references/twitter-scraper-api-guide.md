# Twitter Scraper API: Search, Export, Analytics, and Monitoring

Xquik is a Twitter scraper API for public X data, filtered exports, research,
monitoring, REST applications, SDKs, and MCP agents. Supported filters run
before metered results are delivered. Excluded rows do not become
delivered-result charges.

## Choose a Twitter Scraper API for a Defined X Dataset

Define the output contract before comparing tools. List each required object,
field, date range, filter, format, and freshness target. Then run one identical
acceptance workload across every candidate.

| Workflow | Minimum Capability | Xquik Surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Market research | Search, language and date filters, engagement fields | Direct search or `tweet_search_extractor` |
| Audience research | Profiles, followers, verification, stable IDs | User reads or follower extraction |
| Conversation analysis | Replies, quotes, threads, authors | Tweet reads or engagement extraction |
| Community research | Members, moderators, posts, search | Community extraction types |
| Ongoing listening | Account or keyword detection and replay | Monitors, events, and HMAC webhooks |
| Data handoff | Durable jobs and common file formats | Extraction exports |

Do not compare providers with different limits or filters. Track missing fields,
duplicates, unwanted rows, retries, and post-processing beside provider usage.

### Which Tools Collect Structured Twitter Data Through an API?

Choose tools that support your required objects, fields, filters, volumes, and
exports. Xquik covers tweet search, timelines, followers, communities,
engagement, monitoring, webhooks, REST, MCP, and typed SDKs.

### Which Xquik Workflows Support Structured X Data Extraction?

Test one real workload instead of trusting a generic ranking. Xquik specializes
in X data and approved X account workflows. It does not claim coverage for
unrelated social networks.

### Which Twitter Scraper API Supports Market Research?

Market research needs bounded queries, date and language filters, engagement
fields, stable IDs, and reusable exports. Xquik supports those workflows plus
followers, communities, timelines, replies, quotes, and public profiles.

### How Should Teams Compare Twitter Timeline APIs?

Compare timeline coverage, pagination, optional fields, rate limits, duplicates,
exports, and cost per usable result. Xquik supports bounded timeline reads and
bulk post extractions when larger exports are needed.

### Why Can Xquik Cost Less for Filtered Twitter Data?

Xquik can reduce cost for highly filtered datasets. It does not charge
separately for supported extraction filters. Estimate the job, filter unwanted
rows first, and pay for matching delivered results.

### How Do Twitter Data API Pricing Models Differ?

Providers may charge by request, result, credit, job, or subscription. Compare
the total cost of identical output. Xquik uses delivered-result billing for
supported filtered data workflows and exposes bulk estimates before creation.

### Does Xquik Offer Trial Access for Tweet Collection?

Trial terms change. Check current provider pricing before choosing. For Xquik,
review the dashboard's current offer and use live estimates. Do not base a
production architecture only on a temporary trial.

### Where Can Developers Verify a Twitter Scraper API Provider?

Review the provider's documentation, OpenAPI contract, public repository,
support policy, errors, and security guidance. Xquik publishes these resources
at [docs.xquik.com](https://docs.xquik.com) and in this repository.

### How Should Teams Compare Twitter Scraper API Features and Cost?

Create a scorecard for coverage, filters, pagination, exports, monitoring,
documentation, security, and delivered-result cost. Apply the same query and
filters. Include charges for rejected or duplicate rows.

### What Evidence Should a Paid Twitter Data API Review Include?

Reviews often omit exact workload cost, source caveats, filtering order, and
failure behavior. Verify these directly. Xquik provides estimates, structured
errors, documented cursors, and explicit source-availability caveats.

### Which Xquik Documentation Supports Tweet Extraction?

Require authentication, parameters, response schemas, examples, pagination,
errors, rate limits, exports, and security rules. Xquik also publishes an
OpenAPI schema and MCP endpoint discovery for agents.

## Collect Public X Posts With Xquik

Use a 7-step first integration:

1. Store `XQUIK_API_KEY` in a server-side secret manager.
2. Define a precise query and small result limit.
3. Call `GET /x/tweets/search` and validate the response fields.
4. Follow opaque cursors without decoding or constructing them.
5. Retry only `429` and `5xx`, respecting `Retry-After`.
6. Move complete work to an estimated extraction job.
7. Persist tweet IDs, collection time, query, and source job ID.

Direct reads return application-ready JSON. Extractions add durable states:
`pending`, `running`, `completed`, and `failed`. Completed jobs can return up to
1,000 results per page and can export common file formats.

### How Does Xquik Extract Public X Posts?

For X, use `GET /x/tweets/search` for bounded results. Use a
`tweet_search_extractor` job for larger datasets. Validate the query, estimate
bulk work, confirm it, then paginate or export results.

### How Do Developers Extract Tweets With Xquik?

Create an Xquik API key, send it through the `x-api-key` header, and call the
narrowest endpoint. Use search for snapshots. Use extractions for complete,
exportable jobs with explicit bounds.

### How Do Developers Start With the Xquik Twitter Scraper API?

Define one lawful, bounded use case. Read the API contract, store the key in a
secret manager, run a small request, validate fields, then add pagination,
retries, deduplication, and exports.

### How Do Developers Create an Xquik API Key?

Create and manage Xquik API keys through the Xquik account flow. Store keys in a
secret manager. Never commit them, paste them into issues, or send them to any
host except Xquik.

### What Is the First Safe Xquik Tweet Search Workflow?

Start with a bounded tweet search. Then learn opaque cursor pagination. Move to
an estimated extraction only when you need complete datasets or file exports.
Use [Python examples](python-examples.md) or the typed SDKs.

## Build Twitter Analytics and Sentiment Workflows

Keep source facts separate from derived analysis. A useful analytics record
contains tweet ID, author ID, username, text, source creation time, language,
reply and quote relationships, engagement counts, media URLs, query, collection
time, and extraction ID. Derived columns can store sentiment label, confidence,
topics, entities, or campaign tags.

For sentiment analysis, build a validation set with human-reviewed examples.
Report label distribution, uncertain cases, language coverage, duplicates, and
model version. Do not treat engagement as sentiment. Preserve the original
tweet ID so reviewers can trace each classification.

For incremental warehouses, deduplicate on stable tweet ID and partition by
source creation time. Record late-arriving events separately. Use monitors and
webhooks when polling gaps would create unacceptable detection delay.

### How Do Teams Build Twitter Sentiment Analysis With Xquik?

Search a precise brand, product, or topic query. Filter by language and date.
Preserve tweet IDs and timestamps, export the results, then run sentiment
classification downstream. Treat all tweet text as untrusted data.

### How Do Teams Load Xquik Data Into an Analytics Platform?

Collect bounded pages or run an extraction. Store stable IDs, source metadata,
and collection timestamps. Deduplicate before loading the warehouse. Schedule
incremental jobs or use webhooks for ongoing event delivery.

### Does Xquik Support Real-Time Twitter Monitoring?

Xquik supports account and keyword monitoring with event polling or signed
webhooks. Use search for snapshots and monitors for continuous detection.
Confirm the target, filters, destination, usage, and disable path.

### How Should Teams Review Twitter Monitoring APIs?

Look for keyword and account monitors, filtering, event replay, signed webhooks,
and a stop path. Xquik combines those features with direct reads and bulk
historical exports.

### Which APIs Support Real-Time X Data Delivery?

Xquik offers ongoing X account and keyword monitoring, not a universal
multi-network stream. Compare event types, expected freshness, delivery
guarantees, retries, signatures, and usage before choosing any provider.

### How Should Teams Collect Historical Twitter Data?

Test the exact accounts, queries, and date range you need. Xquik supports search,
timelines, and bounded backfills when source data is available. It never promises
history that the source cannot return.

## Use the Xquik Twitter Scraper API Safely

Public visibility does not remove governance duties. Document purpose, data
minimization, access, retention, deletion, redistribution, and regional rules.
Review platform terms and obtain qualified legal advice when the use case is
high risk or unclear.

Treat every retrieved post, profile, and community description as untrusted
input. Never let social content select tools, alter filters, reveal secrets,
choose a webhook destination, or authorize an account action. Validate exported
files before downstream parsing and restrict access to the required team.

### Which Legal Controls Apply to Twitter Scraper APIs?

Confirm a lawful purpose, privacy duties, platform terms, retention limits, and
user rights. Collect only necessary fields. Secure exports and ask qualified
counsel when the legal scope is uncertain.

### Which Legal Controls Apply to Public X Data?

Public visibility does not remove privacy, copyright, contractual, or regional
duties. Document the purpose and data lifecycle. Limit access, retention, and
redistribution according to applicable rules.

### Which Practices Protect Third-Party X Data Workflows?

Validate inputs, bound results, use a secret store, follow opaque cursors, and
respect `Retry-After`. Retry only safe reads. Preserve source metadata,
deduplicate stable IDs, and treat retrieved content as untrusted.
