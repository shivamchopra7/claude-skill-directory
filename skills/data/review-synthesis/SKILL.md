# review-synthesis

Aggregate multi-reviewer feedback into consolidated, actionable recommendations.

## Triggers

- "synthesize reviews"
- "merge feedback"
- "consolidate comments"
- "combine reviewer input"
- "summarize all feedback"
- "what do reviewers say"

## Purpose

This skill aggregates feedback from multiple reviewers into cohesive, prioritized recommendations by:
- Collecting feedback from parallel review processes
- Identifying consensus and conflicts
- Prioritizing by impact and frequency
- Resolving contradictions with rationale
- Generating actionable synthesis reports

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill:

1. **Collects review inputs**:
   - Gather all reviewer feedback files
   - Parse structured and unstructured comments
   - Identify reviewer roles and expertise areas

2. **Categorizes feedback**:
   - Group by feedback type (content, design, technical, legal)
   - Tag by severity (blocking, major, minor, suggestion)
   - Map to asset sections/elements

3. **Identifies patterns**:
   - Find consensus (multiple reviewers agree)
   - Detect conflicts (reviewers disagree)
   - Note unique insights (single reviewer)

4. **Resolves conflicts**:
   - Apply priority rules
   - Document both positions
   - Provide resolution rationale
   - Flag for escalation if needed

5. **Prioritizes actions**:
   - Rank by business impact
   - Consider implementation effort
   - Group quick wins vs major changes

6. **Generates synthesis**:
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed action items
   - Conflict resolution notes
   - Approval recommendations
