# Creating Pull Requests

## Overview

This skill ensures pull requests are comprehensive, accurate, and useful for future reference. PRs should document the COMPLETE set of changes in a branch, not just what was remembered from the current conversation. PRs must also link to related GitHub issues - most PRs have an associated issue, and these links are critical for tracking work and understanding context.

## Critical Principles

1. **Trust git, not memory** - The git diff is the source of truth, not conversation history
2. **Every changed file matters** - Files are rarely changed by accident; all changes deserve documentation
3. **PRs are searchable documentation** - Titles and descriptions should contain keywords that help find this PR when debugging issues later
4. **Complete > Concise** - A thorough PR description is more valuable than a brief one
5. **Most PRs close an issue** - Actively search for related issues; don't assume none exist just because the user didn't mention one

## Mandatory Workflow

When creating a pull request, execute these steps IN ORDER. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Gather Complete Change Information

Run ALL of these commands to understand the full scope of changes:

```bash
# See all files that differ from the base branch
git diff --name-status $(git merge-base HEAD master)..HEAD

# See the full diff to understand what changed
git diff $(git merge-base HEAD master)..HEAD

# See all commits on this branch
git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD master)..HEAD

# Check for any uncommitted changes that should be included
git status
```

**IMPORTANT**: Read the FULL output of these commands. Do not skim or summarize prematurely.

### Step 2: Search for Related GitHub Issues

**Most PRs should close an issue.** Before creating the PR, actively search for related issues.

```bash
# Search all issues (open and closed) to find any related context
gh issue list --search "keyword1 keyword2" --state all

# Example: If fixing email notifications, try multiple keyword variations:
gh issue list --search "email notification" --state all
gh issue list --search "notification not sent" --state all
```

**Extract keywords from:**
- The branch name (e.g., `fix/email-notifications` → search "email notifications")
- Commit messages from Step 1
- The problem being solved (what would someone have reported?)

**If you find related issues:**
- Note ALL issue numbers that this PR addresses
- The PR description MUST include `Closes #XXX` or `Fixes #XXX` for each

**If no issues are found after searching:**
- ASK THE USER: "I searched for related issues but didn't find any. Is there a GitHub issue this PR should close?"
- Do NOT proceed without confirming - the user may know of an issue you missed

**Common rationalization to avoid:**
> "The user didn't mention an issue, so there probably isn't one"

This is wrong. Users often forget to mention issue numbers. Your job is to find them.

### Step 3: Categorize All Changes

Group every changed file into categories. Common categories include:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Refactoring
- Configuration changes
- Dependency updates
- Test additions/changes
- Documentation

Every file from the diff MUST appear in at least one category.

### Step 4: Write a Comprehensive Title

The PR title should:
- Summarize the PRIMARY purpose of the changes
- Include keywords that would help find this PR later
- Be specific enough to distinguish from similar PRs

**Good**: `fix(router): prevent redirect loop for API routes`
**Bad**: `fix redirect issue`

### Step 5: Write the PR Description

The description MUST include:

#### Summary Section
- 2-5 bullet points covering the main changes
- Each major change category should have at least one bullet
- Reference specific files or components when helpful

#### Files Changed Section
List ALL changed files grouped by purpose. Example:
```
### Bug Fixes
- `src/router.ts` - Fixed redirect logic

### New Features
- `src/components/Feature.tsx` - Added new component

### Configuration
- `config/settings.json` - Updated default values
```

#### Test Plan Section
- How to verify the changes work
- Any manual testing steps required

### Step 6: Self-Review Checklist

Before creating the PR, verify:

- [ ] Every file from `git diff --name-status` is mentioned in the description
- [ ] The title contains searchable keywords related to the changes
- [ ] The description explains WHY changes were made, not just WHAT changed
- [ ] Any breaking changes or migration steps are clearly documented
- [ ] **Issue search completed** - You searched GitHub issues with relevant keywords
- [ ] **Issue linking resolved** - Either: (a) PR includes `Closes #XXX` for found issues, OR (b) You asked the user and confirmed no issue exists

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Relying on Session Memory
**Wrong**: "I changed the router to fix redirects"
**Right**: Run `git diff` and document ALL changes, including ones from earlier in the session or previous sessions

### Omitting "Minor" Changes
**Wrong**: Leaving out config file changes because they seem unimportant
**Right**: Every changed file is documented - config changes often matter for deployment

### Vague Descriptions
**Wrong**: "Fixed some bugs and updated configs"
**Right**: Specific descriptions of what was fixed and why, with file references

### Forgetting Uncommitted Changes
**Wrong**: Creating PR with unstaged changes still pending
**Right**: Run `git status` first and decide if pending changes should be committed

### Assuming No Issue Exists
**Wrong**: "The user didn't mention an issue, so I'll just create the PR without one"
**Right**: Search GitHub for related issues using keywords from the branch name and commit messages. If nothing found, ask the user before proceeding.

### Treating Issue Links as Optional
**Wrong**: `Fixes #1234 (if there was an issue)` or skipping the search entirely
**Right**: Always search for issues. Most PRs have one. Include `Closes #XXX` for every related issue found.

## PR Description Template

Use this template structure:

```markdown
## Summary
- [Primary change/fix with context]
- [Secondary changes]
- [Any additional notable changes]

Closes #XXX

## Changes

### [Category 1]
- `path/to/file.ext` - Description of change

### [Category 2]
- `path/to/file.ext` - Description of change

## Test Plan
- [ ] Step to verify change 1
- [ ] Step to verify change 2

## Notes
[Any additional context, breaking changes, or follow-up work needed]
```

## Rationalizations That Mean You're About to Skip Issue Search

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP. You are rationalizing skipping a required step.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "User didn't mention an issue" | Users forget. Search anyway. |
| "This seems like new work, not a fix" | New features often have tracking issues too. Search. |
| "I'll let the user add issue links" | Your job is to create a complete PR. Search. |
| "Searching would slow things down" | It takes 10 seconds. Do it. |
| "The PR description says 'if applicable'" | Issue search is NOT optional. Always search. |
| "I already know what the PR is about" | You might miss related issues. Search. |

**All of these mean: Run `gh issue list --search` before creating the PR.**
