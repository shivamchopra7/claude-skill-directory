## Additional Detection Capabilities (Merged from codebase-health-auditor)

### Dead Code Detection (via Knip/depcheck)

**Capabilities:**
- Unused files and exports detection (Knip)
- Unused npm dependencies (depcheck)
- TypeScript dead code (unused locals, parameters)
- Vue-specific dead code (unused props, emits, computed, watchers)
- Legacy pattern detection (deprecated libraries, orphaned directories)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Full audit (dry-run by default)
node .claude/skills/📊\ comprehensive-auditor/scripts/orchestrator.js audit

# Execute safe removals only
node .claude/skills/📊\ comprehensive-auditor/scripts/orchestrator.js execute --safe-only

# Single detector
node .claude/skills/📊\ comprehensive-auditor/scripts/orchestrator.js detect --detector file-size

# CI mode
node .claude/skills/📊\ comprehensive-auditor/scripts/orchestrator.js audit --ci
```

### File Size & Token Limit Detection

Detects files that exceed token limits for AI editing tools like Claude Code.

**Why this matters**: Files over ~25,000 tokens become difficult or impossible for AI tools to edit effectively, causing truncation, context loss, and failed edits.

#### Token Thresholds

| Level | Tokens | ~Size | Meaning |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| WARNING | 15,000 | ~60KB | Getting large, monitor |
| CAUTION | 25,000 | ~100KB | Needs attention |
| CRITICAL | 35,000 | ~140KB | Urgent refactoring needed |
| BLOCKED | 50,000 | ~200KB | Blocks AI editing entirely |

#### Usage

```bash
# Detect oversized files
node .claude/skills/📊\ comprehensive-auditor/scripts/orchestrator.js detect --detector file-size

# Custom threshold (e.g., only 20K+ tokens)
node .claude/skills/📊\ comprehensive-auditor/scripts/orchestrator.js detect --detector file-size --min-tokens 20000

# Save report to file
node .claude/skills/📊\ comprehensive-auditor/scripts/orchestrator.js detect --detector file-size --output ./audit-reports/file-size.json
```

#### Refactoring Suggestions

The detector provides context-aware suggestions based on file type:

**Vue Components (.vue)**:
- Extract script logic into composables
- Split into smaller child components
- Consider state extraction to Pinia stores

**TypeScript/JavaScript (.ts/.js)**:
- Split store into feature-specific modules
- Break into smaller, focused composables
- Apply single responsibility principle
- Extract utility functions to separate files

### System Health Analysis (Merged from comprehensive-system-analyzer)

Provides **brutally honest** system health reporting with:
- **Zero sugar-coating** - Tells you exactly what's wrong
- **Complete coverage** - Analyzes every system layer
- **Evidence-based findings** - Provides proof for all issues
- **Prioritized fixes** - Shows what matters most
- **Performance impact** - Quantifies how issues affect users

#### Health Scoring (No Mercy Grading)

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Rare, nearly perfect |
| 80-89 | Good | Minor issues, generally solid |
| 70-79 | Fair | Noticeable issues, needs attention |
| 60-69 | Poor | Significant problems, user-impacting |
| <60 | Critical | Major issues, intervention required |

#### Performance Grades

| Grade | FCP | LCP | TTI |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| A | <2s | <3s | <100ms |
| B | <3s | <4s | <200ms |
| C | <4s | <5s | <300ms |
| D | >4s | >5s | >300ms |
| F | Unusable performance |

#### Analysis Layers

- **Core Application Health**: Vue.js lifecycle, component tree, router, Pinia stores
- **Performance Metrics**: FCP, LCP, TTI, CLS, memory leaks
- **Data Layer**: IndexedDB, store sync, persistence reliability
- **UI/UX Integrity**: Design system compliance, accessibility, responsive design
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit/integration/E2E effectiveness, flaky tests
- **Security Assessment**: Dependencies, code patterns, data exposure
- **Build & Deployment**: Bundle size, asset optimization, production readiness

## Report Format

The auditor generates comprehensive reports with:

### Executive Summary
- Overall health score (weighted across 12 dimensions)
- Overall confidence level
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Blind spot documentation

### Dimension Breakdown
- Individual dimension scores and confidence levels
- Specific findings with evidence
- Actionable recommendations
- Known limitations

### Cross-Dimension Findings
- Issues appearing across multiple dimensions
- Prioritized action items
- Risk assessment based on combined evidence

### Blind Spots Analysis
- What cannot be verified
- Confidence limitations
- Recommendations for improving coverage

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage:** 95%+ of verifiable issues detected
- **False Positives:** <5% of findings
- **Blind Spots:** Explicitly documented, reduced over time
- **Actionability:** 100% of findings have clear next steps
- **Trust:** Never claims certainty beyond evidence

## Honest Limitations

**This skill still cannot:**
- Predict future bugs
- Understand business context without tests/docs
- Verify production state without access
- Detect malicious insider threats
- Know what users actually want

**But it CAN:**
- Cover 95%+ of technical verifiable issues
- Explicitly document the remaining 5%
- Provide actionable, prioritized fixes
- Track improvements over time
- Never claim false certainty

## MANDATORY USER VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT

### Policy: No Fix Claims Without User Confirmation

**CRITICAL**: Before claiming ANY issue, bug, or problem is "fixed", "resolved", "working", or "complete", the following verification protocol is MANDATORY:

#### Step 1: Technical Verification
- Run all relevant tests (build, type-check, unit tests)
- Verify no console errors
- Take screenshots/evidence of the fix

#### Step 2: User Verification Request
**REQUIRED**: Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to explicitly ask the user to verify the fix:

```
"I've implemented [description of fix]. Before I mark this as complete, please verify:
1. [Specific thing to check #1]
2. [Specific thing to check #2]
3. Does this fix the issue you were experiencing?

Please confirm the fix works as expected, or let me know what's still not working."
```

#### Step 3: Wait for User Confirmation
- **DO NOT** proceed with claims of success until user responds
- **DO NOT** mark tasks as "completed" without user confirmation
- **DO NOT** use phrases like "fixed", "resolved", "working" without user verification

#### Step 4: Handle User Feedback
- If user confirms: Document the fix and mark as complete
- If user reports issues: Continue debugging, repeat verification cycle

### Prohibited Actions (Without User Verification)
- Claiming a bug is "fixed"
- Stating functionality is "working"
- Marking issues as "resolved"
- Declaring features as "complete"
- Any success claims about fixes

### Required Evidence Before User Verification Request
1. Technical tests passing
2. Visual confirmation via Playwright/screenshots
3. Specific test scenarios executed
4. Clear description of what was changed

**Remember: The user is the final authority on whether something is fixed. No exceptions.**
