   - Monitor schedule adherence (earned value analysis)
   - Review and approve deliverables
   - Manage scope changes through change control
   - Remove blockers and impediments
   - Facilitate team collaboration

8. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Create communication plan (who, what, when, how)
   - Send regular status reports (weekly/bi-weekly)
   - Conduct stakeholder review meetings
   - Escalate issues and risks appropriately
   - Manage expectations proactively
   - Celebrate milestones and wins

9. **Quality Management**
   - Define quality standards and acceptance criteria

## Sprint Planning Template (Agile)

```markdown
# Sprint {N} Planning - {Date Range}

## Sprint Goal
[One-sentence goal for this sprint]

## Capacity
- Team size: {count} developers
- Sprint duration: {weeks} weeks
- Available capacity: {hours} hours
- Planned capacity: {hours} hours (80% of available)

## Stories Selected
| Story ID | Title | Story Points | Assignee | Dependencies |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| US-123   | ...   | 5            | Alice    | None         |
| US-124   | ...   | 3            | Bob      | US-123       |

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Product owner acceptance

## Risks
- **Risk**: API dependency not ready

- Sprint Review: {date} at {time}
- Sprint Retrospective: {date} at {time}
```

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Score Calculation
Risk Score = Likelihood (1-5) × Impact (1-5)

| Likelihood | Score | Definition |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Very Unlikely | 1 | <10% chance |
| Unlikely | 2 | 10-30% chance |
| Possible | 3 | 30-50% chance |
| Likely | 4 | 50-70% chance |
| Very Likely | 5 | >70% chance |

| Impact | Score | Definition |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Negligible | 1 | <1 day delay, <$1K cost |
| Minor | 2 | 1-3 days delay, <$5K cost |
| Moderate | 3 | 1 week delay, <$20K cost |
| Major | 4 | 2-4 weeks delay, <$50K cost |
| Severe | 5 | >1 month delay, >$50K cost |

### Risk Prioritization
- **Critical (20-25)**: Immediate action required, senior leadership escalation
- **High (15-19)**: Active mitigation, weekly monitoring
- **Medium (8-14)**: Mitigation plan, bi-weekly monitoring
- **Low (1-7)**: Monitor, document, accept risk

     - Mitigation: Use stable API version, monitor changelog
   - 🟡 MEDIUM (Score: 9): PCI compliance gaps found
     - Mitigation: Early security review, buffer time

6. Budget:
   - Labor: $60K (4 devs × 8 weeks)
   - Tools: $5K (Stripe fees, testing)
   - Security audit: $10K
   - Contingency: $5K (6%)

7. Execution:

   - Slack channel for real-time updates
   - Monthly steering committee presentation

9. Quality:
   - Code review required for all PRs
   - >80% test coverage required
   - Security scan before each deployment

10. Closure:
    - All deliverables met, launched to 100% users
    - Retrospective: Payment failures 0.3% (beat 1% target)
    - Lesson: Early security review prevented late delays

Output:
✅ Project delivered ON TIME, ON BUDGET
Timeline: 8 weeks (as planned)
Budget: $78K spent ($80K budget, 2.5% under)
Quality: 0.3% payment failure rate (target: <1%)
Stakeholder satisfaction: 4.8/5.0
```

## Resource Allocation Guidelines

### Optimal Utilization Levels
- **70-80%**: Ideal - allows for slack, meetings, emergencies
- **80-90%**: High - sustainable for short periods only
- **90-100%**: Overutilized - risk of burnout, quality issues
- **>100%**: Critical - immediate intervention required

### Load Balancing Strategies
- Cross-train team members for flexibility
- Maintain 20% buffer for unplanned work
- Balance workload across sprints
- Plan for PTO and holidays
- Avoid single points of failure
