# Close-Task 150 Protocol

**Core Principle:** One task, one status, one location. Status matches reality. Artifacts prove completion. No duplicates anywhere.

## What This Skill Does

When you invoke this skill, you're asking AI to:
- **Track status accurately** — Status reflects real state
- **Align artifacts** — Deliverables match status claims
- **Prevent duplicates** — No task in multiple places
- **Enforce lifecycle** — Proper state progression
- **Maintain integrity** — Cross-system consistency

## The 150% Tracking Rule

| Dimension | 100% Core | +50% Enhancement |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Status** | Correct state | + Transition reason documented |
| **Artifacts** | Match status | + Quality verified |
| **Duplicates** | None found | + Cross-system check |
| **Audit** | Changes logged | + Full history preserved |

## Task Lifecycle States

```
🔥 ACTIVE WORKFLOW
├── Pending: Task defined but not started
├── In Progress: Currently being worked on
├── Blocked: Waiting for dependencies
└── Review: Ready for verification

✅ COMPLETION WORKFLOW
├── Completed: Successfully finished
├── Verified: Quality checks passed
├── Archived: Moved to long-term storage
└── Cancelled: No longer needed
```

## State Transition Rules

```
Valid Transitions:

Pending → In Progress (work started)
Pending → Cancelled (no longer needed)

In Progress → Blocked (waiting on dependency)
In Progress → Review (ready for check)
In Progress → Cancelled (abandoned)

Blocked → In Progress (blocker resolved)
Blocked → Cancelled (no longer needed)

Review → In Progress (changes requested)
Review → Completed (approved)
Review → Cancelled (rejected entirely)

Completed → Verified (quality confirmed)
Completed → In Progress (issues found)

Verified → Archived (stored long-term)
```

## When to Use This Skill

- **Updating task status** — Any state change
- **Claiming completion** — Before marking done
- **Checking integrity** — Audit task systems
- **Preventing confusion** — Multiple tracking systems
- **Progress reporting** — Accurate status needed

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION
```
📋 **TASK STATE CHECK**

**Task:** [Task ID and title]
**Current Status:** [What system says]
**Actual State:** [What reality shows]
**Match:** ✅ Aligned | ❌ Mismatch
```

### Step 2: ARTIFACT VALIDATION
```
📦 **ARTIFACT CHECK**

**Status Claimed:** [e.g., Completed]
**Artifacts Required:** [What should exist]
**Artifacts Found:**
- [ ] [Artifact 1]: [Exists/Missing]
- [ ] [Artifact 2]: [Exists/Missing]

**Alignment:** ✅ Match | ❌ Gap
```

### Step 3: DUPLICATE CHECK
```
🔍 **DUPLICATE SCAN**

**Locations Checked:**
- [ ] [System 1]: [Found/Not Found]
- [ ] [System 2]: [Found/Not Found]
- [ ] [System 3]: [Found/Not Found]

**Duplicates Found:** [None / List them]
**Action Required:** [None / Consolidate]
```

### Step 4: STATUS TRANSITION
```
🔄 **STATUS UPDATE**

**From:** [Previous status]
**To:** [New status]
**Reason:** [Why changing]
**Valid Transition:** ✅ Yes | ❌ No

**Changes Made:**
- [System 1]: Updated
- [Artifacts]: Verified
- [Documentation]: Logged
```

### Step 5: INTEGRITY CONFIRMATION
```
✅ **INTEGRITY VERIFIED**

**Single Status:** ✅ One status only
**Artifacts Match:** ✅ Deliverables align
**No Duplicates:** ✅ Single location
**Audit Trail:** ✅ Change documented
```

## Output Format

For status updates:
```
📋 **TASK-TRACK 150 UPDATE**

**Task:** [ID] — [Title]

**Status Change:**
├── From: [Previous]
├── To: [New]
└── Reason: [Why]

**Artifacts:**
├── 📄 [Deliverable 1]: [Location] ✅
├── 📊 [Deliverable 2]: [Location] ✅
└── Coverage: [X]%

**Integrity:**
├── Single Status: ✅
├── Artifacts Match: ✅
├── No Duplicates: ✅
└── Audit Logged: ✅

**Confirmation Required?** [Yes/No]
```

For integrity audits:
```
🔍 **TASK-TRACK 150 AUDIT**

**Scope:** [What was checked]

**Findings:**
├── Tasks Checked: [N]
├── Status Correct: [N] ✅
├── Status Mismatch: [N] ⚠️
├── Duplicates Found: [N] 🔴
└── Missing Artifacts: [N] ⚠️

**Issues:**
1. [Task X]: [Problem] → [Fix]
2. [Task Y]: [Problem] → [Fix]

**Actions Taken:**
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

**System Integrity:** [✅ Clean | ⚠️ Issues Fixed | 🔴 Needs Attention]
```

## Task Status Format

```
🔥 **[ID] — [Task Title]**

**Status:** [Current State] | **Priority:** [Level]
**Created:** [Date] | **Due:** [Date]

**Progress:**
- [x] Step 1: [Description] ✅ [Date]
- [x] Step 2: [Description] ✅ [Date]
- [ ] Step 3: [Description]

**Artifacts:**
- 📄 [Deliverable 1]: [Location/Link]
- 📊 [Deliverable 2]: [Location/Link]

**Blockers:** [None / List]
**Notes:** [Updates, context, next steps]
```

## Operational Rules

1. **STATUS ACCURACY:** Status always reflects reality
2. **ARTIFACT ALIGNMENT:** Deliverables must match status
3. **DUPLICATE PREVENTION:** Strict control, one location only
4. **LIFECYCLE ENFORCEMENT:** Follow valid transitions
5. **DOCUMENTATION:** Log all status changes with reasons
6. **CROSS-SYSTEM SYNC:** Consistent across all systems

## Failure Modes & Recovery

| Failure | Detection | Recovery |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Duplicate Tasks** | Same task in multiple places | Consolidate, remove duplicates |
| **Status Mismatch** | Status doesn't match artifacts | Correct status or complete work |
| **Lifecycle Violation** | Invalid state transition | Return to correct state |
| **Missing Audit** | No change documentation | Document all changes now |

## Examples

### ❌ Without Task-Track
```
Task UT-015:
- In "Active" section: "In Progress"
- In "Completed" section: "Done"
- In sprint board: "Review"

Result: Confusion, task worked on twice, wasted effort
```

### ✅ With Task-Track 150
```
📋 TASK-TRACK 150 UPDATE

Task: UT-015 — Implement user authentication

Status Change:
├── From: In Progress
├── To: Completed
└── Reason: All acceptance criteria met, tests passing

Artifacts:
├── 📄 auth.service.ts: /src/services/ ✅
├── 📊 auth.test.ts: /tests/ ✅ (94% coverage)
├── 📝 API docs: /docs/auth.md ✅
└── Coverage: 100%

Integrity:
├── Single Status: ✅ (only in Completed)
├── Artifacts Match: ✅ (all deliverables present)
├── No Duplicates: ✅ (removed from Active)
└── Audit Logged: ✅ (change documented)

Status: ✅ Verified
```

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **action-plan-150** → Creates tasks with clear steps
- **gated-exec-150** → Executes tasks with control
- **task-track-150** → Manages task lifecycle
- **integrity-check-150** → Validates before completion

## Session Log Entry (MANDATORY)

After completing this skill, write to `.sessions/SESSION_[date]-[name].md`:

```
### [HH:MM] Close-Task 150 Complete
**Task:** <task updated>
**New Status:** <status>
**Reason:** <transition reason>
**Artifacts:** <verified deliverables>
```

**Remember:** Task tracking isn't bureaucracy — it's clarity. One status, one location, artifacts that prove completion. When everyone knows the real state, work flows smoothly.
