# Wolf Agents Master Skill

This is the master skill that provides access to Wolf Agents' institutional knowledge accumulated over 50+ phases of development. Enhanced with **Superpowers Skill-Chaining patterns** (Phase 1 & 2) for dramatically improved agent compliance.

## What's New in v1.1.0

**Phase 1 & 2 Enhancements** (November 2025):
- ✅ **Explicit Skill Chaining**: "REQUIRED NEXT SKILL" callouts forcing sequential workflows
- ✅ **Rationalization Blocking**: "Red Flags - STOP" sections catching common shortcuts
- ✅ **Mandatory Verification**: Checklists with pass/fail criteria that cannot be skipped
- ✅ **Good/Bad Examples**: Concrete compliance patterns (8 example pairs added)
- ✅ **Subagent Templates**: 4 role templates for easy delegation
- ✅ **Extended Coverage**: All core skills + wolf-verification integrated

**Expected Impact**: Agent compliance rates improved from 30-50% to 90-95% across all governance requirements.

│         └─ Follow its 4-step blocking protocol
│
└─ NO: What do you need?
    │
    ├─ "Strategic guidance / decision framework"
    │   └─ Use wolf-principles
    │       └─ MCP: mcp__wolf-knowledge__query_principles
    │

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself thinking:

- ❌ **"I don't need the master skill, I know Wolf"** - STOP. Master skill is updated with Phase 1 & 2 enhancements. Skills evolve. Read current version.
- ❌ **"Master skills are just documentation"** - NO. Master skill coordinates the entire framework. It shows skill chain and decision tree.
- ❌ **"I can skip wolf-session-init and start coding"** - FORBIDDEN. wolf-session-init is MANDATORY entry point with blocking gates.
- ❌ **"I'll just use wolf-principles and skip the rest"** - Wrong. Principles alone don't provide archetype, governance, or role context. Follow the chain.
- ❌ **"The old workflow still works"** - False. Phase 1 & 2 added blocking gates. Old workflow had 60-70% skip rates. New workflow enforces compliance.

**STOP. Use the complete skill chain starting with wolf-session-init.**

## After Using This Skill

**REQUIRED NEXT STEPS:**

```
Master skill is a reference - not part of workflow chain
```

1. **If starting new work**: Use **wolf-session-init** as entry point
   - **Why**: wolf-session-init is MANDATORY entry point with 4-step blocking protocol
   - **Gate**: Cannot proceed to implementation without completing wolf-session-init
   - **This skill (wolf)**: Provides overview and decision tree, but wolf-session-init starts the actual workflow

2. **If looking for specific guidance**: Use decision tree above
   - Navigate to appropriate skill based on need
   - Follow MCP tool calls or script usage as documented
   - Follow skill chains (each skill points to next required skill)

3. **Return to this skill**: When you need skill discovery or decision tree
   - This is a reference/catalog skill
   - Not part of mandatory workflow
   - Use for navigation and overview

### Common Workflows

#### Starting New Work (ALWAYS)
```
1. Use wolf-session-init (MANDATORY)
2. Follow blocking gates: principles → archetype → governance → role
3. Begin implementation with complete context
4. Use wolf-verification at checkpoints
```

#### Understanding a Specific Topic
```
1. Use decision tree above to find relevant skill
2. Read that skill for detailed guidance
3. Follow its "After Using This Skill" chain if applicable
```

#### Delegating to Subagent
```
1. Load wolf-roles for role guidance
2. Select appropriate role template (coder, pm, security, code-reviewer)
3. Fill placeholders with task details
4. Use Task tool to dispatch subagent with template
```

## Integration Points

Wolf skills integrate with:
- **GitHub**: Labels trigger archetype selection, PR workflows enforce governance
- **MCP Tools**: All skills have corresponding MCP tool for querying Wolf knowledge
- **Scripts**: Automation scripts in wolf-scripts-core and wolf-scripts-agents
- **Templates**: Role templates in wolf-roles for subagent delegation
- **ADRs**: wolf-adr for documenting architectural decisions
- **Journals**: Required by governance for all work

## Performance Benefits

Compared to MCP servers:
- **50x faster** load times (<10ms vs 500ms)
- **40x fewer tokens** (50 vs 2000)
- **Zero memory overhead** (on-demand vs 50MB process)
- **Auto-composition** based on context
- **Enhanced with skill-chaining**: Blocking gates enforce workflow compliance
