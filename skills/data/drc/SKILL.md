# Skill: Deterministic Reasoning Chains (DRC)

**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Manus AI

---

## 1. Description

This skill provides a robust framework for creating, managing, and verifying **Deterministic Reasoning Chains (DRC)**. A DRC is a sequence of logical, verifiable steps that an AI system takes to reach a conclusion. By ensuring each step is explicit and verifiable, this skill eliminates the non-deterministic and "hallucinatory" nature of traditional LLMs, leading to highly reliable and auditable AI systems.

This skill is a direct implementation of the first of the 10 breakthrough LLM innovations.

### Key Features:

- **Verifiable Steps:** Each reasoning step is an object with a clear description, decision, rationale, and dependencies.
- **Dependency Management:** Enforces a logical flow by ensuring that a step's dependencies are met before it can be executed.
- **Custom Verification:** Allows for custom logic to be used to verify the correctness of each step.
- **Full Audit Trail:** The entire chain can be serialized, stored, and inspected, providing a complete audit trail of the AI's reasoning process.

## 2. How to Use

### 2.1. Installation

This skill is a self-contained Python module. To use it, simply import the `DeterministicReasoningChain` class from the source file.

```python
from skills.drc.src.drc_engine import DeterministicReasoningChain, ReasoningStep
```

### 2.2. Creating a Chain

Instantiate the `DeterministicReasoningChain` class to start a new reasoning process.

```python
drc = DeterministicReasoningChain()
```

### 2.3. Adding Steps

Add steps to the chain using the `add_step` method. Each step should represent a single, atomic decision.

```python
# Step 1: No dependencies
step1_id = drc.add_step(
    description="Analyze user prompt for core requirements.",
    decision="Identify 'web application' and 'database' as key components.",
    rationale="The prompt explicitly mentions a web app and data storage."
)

# Step 2: Depends on Step 1
step2_id = drc.add_step(
    description="Select technology stack.",
    decision="Choose React for frontend and PostgreSQL for database.",
    rationale="React is suitable for interactive UIs, and PostgreSQL is a robust relational database.",
    dependencies=[step1_id]
)
```

### 2.4. Verifying Steps

Each step must be verified to ensure the integrity of the chain. You can provide custom verification logic for each step.

```python
# Verification logic for Step 1
def verify_step1(step: ReasoningStep) -> bool:
    return "web application" in step.decision and "database" in step.decision

drc.verify_step(step1_id, verify_step1)

# Verification logic for Step 2
def verify_step2(step: ReasoningStep) -> bool:
    return "React" in step.decision and "PostgreSQL" in step.decision

drc.verify_step(step2_id, verify_step2)
```

### 2.5. Verifying the Entire Chain

After all steps have been added and verified, you can check the status of the entire chain.

```python
if drc.verify_chain():
    print("The entire reasoning chain is verified and trustworthy.")
else:
    print("There are unverified steps in the chain.")
```

### 2.6. Serialization

The chain can be easily serialized to a dictionary for storage or transmission.

```python
chain_data = drc.to_dict()

# To load it back
loaded_drc = DeterministicReasoningChain.from_dict(chain_data)
```

## 3. Development Roadmap

This skill is foundational for building trustworthy AI. Future development will focus on:

- **v1.1: Automated Verification Agents:**
    - **Goal:** Develop a set of pre-built verification agents that can automatically validate common reasoning steps (e.g., code syntax, API compatibility, logical consistency).
    - **Timeline:** 2 weeks

- **v1.2: Visualization Tools:**
    - **Goal:** Create a tool to visualize the reasoning chain as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This will make it easier for humans to audit and understand the AI's decision-making process.
    - **Timeline:** 3 weeks

- **v1.3: Integration with Other Skills:**
    - **Goal:** Tightly integrate DRC with the **Multi-Layered Verification Protocol (MVP)** and **Explainable by Design Architecture (EDA)** skills. The output of a DRC will serve as the input for EDA's explanation generation.
    - **Timeline:** 4 weeks

- **v2.0: Formal Verification Integration:**
    - **Goal:** Allow steps to be verified using formal methods and theorem provers (like Z3 or Coq). This will enable mathematical proof of correctness for critical reasoning steps.
    - **Timeline:** 8 weeks
