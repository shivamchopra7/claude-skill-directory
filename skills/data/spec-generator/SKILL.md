# Spec Generator - Flexible Increment Documentation

**Purpose**: Automatically generate comprehensive specification documentation (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md with embedded tests) for SpecWeave increments using proven templates and flexible, context-aware structure.

**When to Use**:
- Creating new increments (`/sw:inc`)
- Planning features or products
- Generating structured documentation
- Converting ideas into actionable specs

**Based On**: Flexible Spec Generator (V2) - context-aware, non-rigid templates

---

## How Spec Generator Works

### 1. Flexible Spec Generation (spec.md)

**Adapts to Context**:
- **New Product**: Full PRD with market analysis, user personas, competitive landscape
- **Feature Addition**: Focused user stories, acceptance criteria, integration points
- **Bug Fix**: Problem statement, root cause, solution, impact analysis
- **Refactoring**: Current state, proposed changes, benefits, migration plan

**YAML Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
increment: 0001-feature-name
title: "Feature Title"
type: feature
priority: P1
status: planned
created: 2025-12-04
# NOTE: project: and board: fields REMOVED from frontmatter!
# Use per-US **Project**: and **Board**: fields instead (see below)
---
```

**⛔ CRITICAL RULE: Every User Story MUST have `**Project**:` field!**

This is MANDATORY in BOTH single-project AND multi-project modes.

**Core Sections** (Always Present):
```markdown
# Product Specification: [Increment Name]

**Increment**: [ID]
**Title**: [Title]
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: [P0-P3]
**Created**: [Date]

## Executive Summary
[1-2 paragraph overview]

## Problem Statement
### Current State
### User Pain Points
### Target Audience

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

<!--
⛔ MANDATORY: **Project**: field on EVERY User Story
- Single-project: Use config.project.name value
- Multi-project: Use one of multiProject.projects keys
NEVER generate a User Story without **Project**: field!
-->

### US-001: [Title]
**Project**: [MANDATORY - use config.project.name or multiProject.projects key]
**Board**: [MANDATORY for 2-level structures only]

**As a** [user type]
**I want** [goal]
**So that** [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **AC-US1-01**: [Criterion 1]
- [ ] **AC-US1-02**: [Criterion 2]

---

### MANDATORY STEP 0: Get Project Context FIRST

**⛔ YOU CANNOT GENERATE spec.md UNTIL YOU COMPLETE THIS STEP!**

**This step is BLOCKING - do not proceed until you have actual project/board IDs.**

**🧠 ULTRATHINK REQUIRED - ANALYZE ALL AVAILABLE CONTEXT FIRST!**

Before assigning ANY project, you MUST analyze:
1. **Living docs structure**: `ls .specweave/docs/internal/specs/` - what project folders exist?
2. **Recent increments**: `grep -r "^\*\*Project\*\*:" .specweave/increments/*/spec.md | tail -10`
3. **config.json**: Read `project.name` (single-project) or `multiProject.projects` (multi-project)
4. **Feature description**: What does the user want to build? Match to existing projects.

**1. Run the context API command:**
```bash
specweave context projects
```

**2. Parse the JSON output:**
```json
{
  "level": 1,
  "projects": [{"id": "frontend-app", "name": "Frontend App"}],
  "detectionReason": "multiProject configuration"
}
```
For 2-level:
```json
{
  "level": 2,
  "projects": [{"id": "acme-corp", "name": "ACME Corp"}],
  "boardsByProject": {
    "acme-corp": [
      {"id": "digital-ops", "name": "Digital Operations"},
      {"id": "mobile-team", "name": "Mobile Team"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**3. 🧠 ULTRATHINK - SMART PROJECT RESOLUTION:**

**RESOLUTION PRIORITY (MUST FOLLOW THIS ORDER!):**
```
1. ✅ EXACT MATCH: config.project.name or multiProject.projects key → USE IT
2. ✅ LIVING DOCS: Existing folder in specs/ → USE THAT PROJECT ID
3. ✅ RECENT PATTERNS: Same feature type in past increments → USE SAME PROJECT
4. ⚠️  UNCERTAIN: Multiple valid options OR no clear match → ASK USER!
5. 🔄 FALLBACK: If all else fails → USE "default" (NEVER "specweave"!)
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL: IF UNCERTAIN - YOU MUST ASK THE USER!**
```
I found multiple potential projects for this feature:
- frontend-app (keywords: UI, form, React)
- backend-api (keywords: API, endpoint)

Which project should I assign to this feature?
```

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
- Silently assign to "specweave" (that's the framework name, not user's project!)
- Guess without analyzing context
- Skip asking when genuinely uncertain

**✅ CORRECT FALLBACK (when no projects configured):**
```
**Project**: default
```

**4. STORE the actual IDs for use in spec.md:**
```
RESOLVED_PROJECT = "frontend-app"  // from projects[].id
RESOLVED_BOARD = "digital-ops"     // from boardsByProject (2-level only)
```

**5. Now generate spec.md using RESOLVED values (NEVER placeholders!)**

---

### Per-US Project Resolution (MANDATORY)

**🧠 USE CONTEXT API OUTPUT + LIVING DOCS TO RESOLVE PROJECT/BOARD:**

After running `specweave context projects`, you have the valid project/board IDs.
Now map each user story to the correct project:

**Resolution Flow:**
```
1. Get valid projects from context API: ["frontend-app", "backend-api", "shared"]
2. Analyze feature description for keywords
3. Map keywords to ACTUAL project IDs (from step 1, NOT generic terms!)
4. Assign each US to its project
```

**Resolution Example:**
```
Context API returned: projects = ["frontend-app", "backend-api", "shared"]

Feature: "Add OAuth login to React frontend"
Detected keywords: "React", "frontend", "login"

Mapping:
- "frontend" keyword → matches "frontend-app" (from context API)
- "login" spans frontend + backend

Result:
  US-001 (Login UI) → **Project**: frontend-app
  US-002 (Auth API) → **Project**: backend-api
```

**VALIDATION RULES:**

```
✅ REQUIRED: Run "specweave context projects" BEFORE generating spec.md
✅ REQUIRED: Use ONLY project IDs from the API response
✅ REQUIRED: Each US has explicit **Project**: field with resolved value
✅ REQUIRED: For 2-level, each US has explicit **Board**: field with resolved value

❌ FORBIDDEN: Generating spec.md without running context API first
❌ FORBIDDEN: Using {{PROJECT_ID}} or {{BOARD_ID}} placeholders
❌ FORBIDDEN: Using generic keywords as project names ("frontend" vs "frontend-app")
❌ FORBIDDEN: Inventing project names not in the API response
```

## Success Metrics
[How we'll measure success]

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
[What we're NOT doing in this increment]
```

**Flexible Sections** (Context-Dependent):
- **Competitive Analysis** (if new product)
- **Technical Requirements** (if complex feature)
- **API Design** (if backend API)
- **UI/UX Requirements** (if frontend)
- **Security Considerations** (if auth/data)
- **Migration Plan** (if breaking change)

### 2. Technical Plan Generation (plan.md)

**Adapts to Complexity**:
- **Simple Feature**: Component list, data flow, implementation steps
- **Complex System**: Full architecture, C4 diagrams, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment architecture, scaling strategy, monitoring

**Core Sections**:
```markdown
# Technical Plan: [Increment Name]

## Architecture Overview
[System design, components, interactions]

## Component Architecture

### Phase 2: [Name]

## Testing Strategy
[Unit, integration, E2E approach]

## Deployment Plan
[How we'll roll this out]

## Risks & Mitigations
```

### 3. Task Breakdown Generation (tasks.md)

**Smart Task Creation**:
```markdown
# Implementation Tasks: [Increment Name]

## Task Overview
**Total Tasks**: [N]
**Estimated Duration**: [X weeks]
**Priority**: [P0]

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - X tasks

### T-001: [Task Title]

**Test Levels**: [Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance]
**Coverage Target**: 80%+ overall, 90%+ critical

---

## Unit Tests (X test cases)

### TC-001: [Test Name]
```[language]
describe('[Component]', () => {
  it('[should do something]', async () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });
});
```

## Integration Tests (X test cases)
## E2E Tests (X test cases)
## Performance Tests (X test cases)

## Coverage Requirements
- Critical paths: 90%+
- Overall: 80%+
```

---

## Spec Generator Templates

### Template Selection Logic

**Input Analysis**:
1. Analyze increment description (keywords, complexity)
2. Detect domain (frontend, backend, infra, ML, etc.)
3. Determine scope (feature, product, bug fix, refactor)
4. Assess technical complexity (simple, moderate, complex)

**Template Selection**:
```
IF new_product THEN
  spec_template = "Full PRD"
  plan_template = "System Architecture"
ELSE IF feature_addition THEN
  spec_template = "User Stories Focused"
  plan_template = "Component Design"
ELSE IF bug_fix THEN
  spec_template = "Problem-Solution"
  plan_template = "Implementation Steps"
ELSE IF refactoring THEN
  spec_template = "Current-Proposed"
  plan_template = "Migration Strategy"
END IF
```

### Context-Aware Sections

**Auto-Include Based On**:
- **"authentication"** → Security Considerations, JWT/OAuth design
- **"API"** → API Design, OpenAPI spec, rate limiting
- **"database"** → ER diagrams, migration scripts, indexes
- **"frontend"** → Component hierarchy, state management, UI/UX
- **"deployment"** → CI/CD, infrastructure, monitoring
- **"ML"** → Model architecture, training pipeline, evaluation metrics

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature
```
User: /sw:inc "Add dark mode toggle to settings"

Spec Generator:
✓ Detected: Frontend feature (UI component)
✓ Complexity: Simple
✓ Template: User Stories + Component Design

Generating specifications...
✓ spec.md: 3 user stories, UI mockups section
✓ plan.md: Component design, state management, CSS-in-JS
✓ tasks.md: 8 tasks (component, styles, state, tests)
✓ tests.md: Unit tests for component, E2E for toggle
```

### Example 2: Complex System
```
User: /sw:inc "Multi-tenant SaaS platform with billing"

Spec Generator:
✓ Detected: New product (SaaS, multi-tenant, payments)
✓ Complexity: High
✓ Template: Full PRD + System Architecture

Generating specifications...
✓ spec.md: Market analysis, personas, competitive landscape, 15 user stories
✓ plan.md: Multi-tenant architecture, database per tenant, Stripe integration, C4 diagrams
✓ tasks.md: 40 tasks across 4 weeks (auth, tenancy, billing, UI)
✓ tests.md: 100+ test cases (unit, integration, E2E, load testing)
```

### Example 3: Bug Fix
```
User: /sw:inc "Fix race condition in user session handling"

Spec Generator:
✓ Detected: Bug fix (concurrency issue)
✓ Complexity: Moderate
✓ Template: Problem-Solution

Generating specifications...
✓ spec.md: Problem statement, root cause analysis, impact, solution
✓ plan.md: Current implementation, proposed fix, Redis locking
✓ tasks.md: 5 tasks (analysis, fix, tests, rollout, monitoring)
✓ tests.md: Concurrency tests, stress tests
```

## Integration with /sw:inc

The Spec Generator is automatically invoked by `/sw:inc`:

1. **User Intent Analysis**:
   - Analyze increment description
   - Detect keywords, domain, complexity

2. **Template Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate templates
   - Auto-include relevant sections

3. **Specification Generation**:
   - Generate spec.md with PM context
   - Generate plan.md with Architect context
   - Generate tasks.md with breakdown
   - Generate tests.md with coverage strategy

4. **User Review**:
   - Show generated structure
   - Allow refinement
   - Confirm before creating files

---

## Advantages Over Rigid Templates

**Flexible (V2) Approach**:
- ✅ Adapts to increment type (product, feature, bug fix, refactor)
- ✅ Includes only relevant sections
- ✅ Scales complexity up/down
- ✅ Domain-aware (frontend, backend, ML, infra)
- ✅ Faster for simple increments
- ✅ Comprehensive for complex products

**Rigid (V1) Approach**:
- ❌ Same template for everything
- ❌ Many irrelevant sections
- ❌ Wastes time on simple features
- ❌ Insufficient for complex products
- ❌ One-size-fits-none

---

## Configuration

Users can customize spec generation in `.specweave/config.yaml`:

```yaml
spec_generator:
  # Default complexity level
  default_complexity: moderate  # simple | moderate | complex

  # Always include sections
  always_include:
    - executive_summary
    - user_stories
    - success_metrics

  # Never include sections
  never_include:
    - competitive_analysis  # We're not doing market research

  # Domain defaults
  domain_defaults:
    frontend:
      include: [ui_mockups, component_hierarchy, state_management]
    backend:
      include: [api_design, database_schema, authentication]
```

---

## 🔀 Multi-Project User Story Generation

**CRITICAL**: When umbrella/multi-project mode is detected, user stories MUST be generated per-project!

### Detection (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**Automated Detection**: Use `detectMultiProjectMode(projectRoot)` from `src/utils/multi-project-detector.ts`. This utility checks ALL config formats automatically.

**Manual check (for agents)**: Read `.specweave/config.json` and check:
- `umbrella.enabled` + `childRepos[]`
- `multiProject.enabled` + `projects{}`
- `sync.profiles[].config.boardMapping`
- Multiple folders in `.specweave/docs/internal/specs/`

**If ANY of these conditions are TRUE → Multi-project mode ACTIVE:**
- `umbrella.enabled: true` in config.json
- `umbrella.childRepos` has entries
- Multiple project folders exist in `specs/` (e.g., `sw-app-fe/`, `sw-app-be/`, `sw-app-shared/`)
- User prompt mentions: "3 repos", "frontend repo", "backend API", "shared library"

### Per-User-Story Project Targeting (PREFERRED)

Each user story specifies its target project inline:

```markdown
## User Stories

### US-001: Thumbnail Upload & Comparison (P1)
**Project**: frontend-app
**Board**: ui-team        <!-- 2-level structures only -->
**As a** content creator
**I want** to upload multiple thumbnail variants
**So that** I can visually evaluate my options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **AC-US1-01**: User can drag-and-drop up to 5 images

---

### US-002: CTR Prediction API (P1)
**Project**: backend-api
**Board**: ml-team        <!-- 2-level structures only -->
**As a** frontend application
**I want** to call POST /predict-ctr endpoint
**So that** I can get AI-powered predictions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **AC-US2-01**: POST /predict-ctr accepts thumbnail image
```

**Benefits of per-US targeting:**
- Each US syncs to correct project/repo
- Single increment can span multiple projects
- Living docs auto-grouped by project
- External tools (GitHub/JIRA/ADO) receive issues in correct project

### Multi-Project User Story Format (with **Project**: per US)

**✅ CORRECT Format - Every US has `**Project**:`:**
```markdown
## User Stories

### US-001: Thumbnail Upload
**Project**: frontend-app       # ← MANDATORY!
**As a** content creator
**I want** to upload thumbnails
**So that** I can test different versions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **AC-US1-01**: User can drag-and-drop images
- [ ] **AC-US1-02**: Images validated for YouTube specs

### US-002: Thumbnail Analysis API
**Project**: backend-api        # ← MANDATORY! Different project = different folder
**As a** frontend application
**I want** to call POST /predict-ctr endpoint
**So that** I can get AI-powered predictions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **AC-US2-01**: POST /predict-ctr endpoint accepts thumbnail image
- [ ] **AC-US2-02**: ML model returns prediction score
```

### Project Classification Rules

When analyzing user descriptions, classify each user story by keywords:

| Keywords | Project | Prefix |
|----------|---------|--------|
| UI, component, page, form, view, drag-drop, theme, builder, menu display | Frontend | FE |
| API, endpoint, CRUD, webhook, analytics, database, service, ML model | Backend | BE |
| types, schemas, validators, utilities, localization, common | Shared | SHARED |
| iOS, Android, mobile app, push notification | Mobile | MOBILE |
| Terraform, K8s, Docker, CI/CD, deployment | Infrastructure | INFRA |

### AC-ID Format by Project

```
AC-{PROJECT}-US{story}-{number}

Examples:
- AC-FE-US1-01 (Frontend, User Story 1, AC #1)
- AC-BE-US1-01 (Backend, User Story 1, AC #1)
- AC-SHARED-US1-01 (Shared, User Story 1, AC #1)
- AC-MOBILE-US1-01 (Mobile, User Story 1, AC #1)
```

### tasks.md Must Reference Project-Scoped User Stories

```markdown
### T-001: Create Thumbnail Upload Component
**User Story**: US-FE-001           ← MUST reference project-scoped ID!
**Satisfies ACs**: AC-FE-US1-01, AC-FE-US1-02
**Status**: [ ] Not Started

### T-004: Database Schema & Migrations
**User Story**: US-BE-001, US-BE-002   ← Backend stories only!
**Satisfies ACs**: AC-BE-US1-01, AC-BE-US2-01
**Status**: [ ] Not Started
```

### Workflow Summary

```
1. DETECT multi-project mode (check config.json, folder structure)
   ↓
2. If multi-project → Group user stories by project (FE/BE/SHARED/MOBILE/INFRA)
   ↓
3. Generate prefixed user stories: US-FE-001, US-BE-001, US-SHARED-001
   ↓
4. Generate prefixed ACs: AC-FE-US1-01, AC-BE-US1-01
   ↓
5. Generate tasks referencing correct project user stories
   ↓
6. Each project folder gets its own filtered spec
```

### Why This Matters

Without project-scoped stories:
- ❌ All issues created in ONE repo (wrong!)
- ❌ No clarity which team owns what
- ❌ Tasks reference wrong user stories
- ❌ GitHub sync broken across repos

With project-scoped stories:
- ✅ Each repo gets only its user stories
- ✅ Clear ownership per team/repo
- ✅ GitHub issues in correct repo
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Project-Specific Learnings

**Before starting work, check for project-specific learnings:**

```bash
# Check if skill memory exists for this skill
cat .specweave/skill-memories/spec-generator.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No project learnings yet"
```

Project learnings are automatically captured by the reflection system when corrections or patterns are identified during development. These learnings help you understand project-specific conventions and past decisions.
