## When to use

Use this skill when you are:
- Screening Pendle PTs and YTs across chains (fixed vs floating yield, liquidity/volume, expiry)
- Pulling Pendle market time series (prices, APYs, TVL)
- Building swap payloads (tx + approvals) to buy/sell PTs or YTs via Pendle Hosted SDK

## How to use

- [rules/high-value-reads.md](rules/high-value-reads.md) - Discovery + time series (data in/out)
- [rules/execution-opportunities.md](rules/execution-opportunities.md) - Swap payload building and “best PT” selection
- [rules/gotchas.md](rules/gotchas.md) - Units, chain IDs, address formats, and integration hazards
