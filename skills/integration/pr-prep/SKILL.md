Triggers: pr, quality-gates, prep, git, testing
  Prepare a pull request by validating the workspace, running quality gates,
  summarizing changes, and drafting the PR template.

  Triggers: PR preparation, pull request, quality gates, PR template, PR summary,
  branch preparation, merge request

  Use when: preparing PRs for submission, running quality gates, drafting
  PR descriptions and templates

  DO NOT use when: reviewing existing PRs - use pr-review instead.
  DO NOT use when: just generating commit messages - use commit-messages.

  Use this skill for PR preparation.

# Pull Request Preparation Workflow

## When to Use
Use this skill to stage work and produce a PR summary/description.
Run `Skill(sanctum:git-workspace-review)` first so the repository state and diffs are already captured.

## Required TodoWrite Items
Create `TodoWrite` items for each of these steps before you start:
1. `pr-prep:workspace-reviewed`
2. `pr-prep:quality-gates`
3. `pr-prep:changes-summarized`
4. `pr-prep:testing-documented`
5. `pr-prep:pr-drafted`
6. `pr-prep:content-verified` - AI slop detection via scribe

Mark them as complete as each section is finished.

## Step 1: Review Workspace (`workspace-reviewed`)
- Confirm `Skill(sanctum:git-workspace-review)` has been completed.
- If new changes were staged since running it, rerun that skill.

## Step 2: Run Quality Gates (`quality-gates`)
- Execute formatting, linting, and tests using project commands (e.g., `make fmt`, `make lint`, `make test`).
- If commands differ, note what was run.
- Resolve failures before continuing.
- If a task cannot run locally, state why and what alternative validation was done.
- **See `modules/quality-gates.md`** for language-specific commands and failure handling.

## Step 3: Summarize Changes (`changes-summarized`)
- Use the notes from `Skill(sanctum:git-workspace-review)` and `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD` to understand the scope.
- Skim diffs for key points.
- Group them into 2-4 bullets highlighting the "why" and "what".
- Note breaking changes, migrations, or documentation updates.

## Step 4: Document Testing (`testing-documented`)
- List each test and command that was run and its result.
- Include manual verification steps if relevant.
- If tests were skipped, explain the mitigation plan.

## Step 5: Draft the PR (`pr-drafted`)
- Fill out the standard template with Summary, Changes, Testing, and Checklist sections.
- Add issue references, screenshots, or follow-up TODOs.
- **See `modules/pr-template.md`** for template structure and examples.

## Step 6: Verify Content Quality (`content-verified`)

Apply `Skill(scribe:slop-detector)` principles to the drafted PR description.

### Writing Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify the PR description:

- [ ] No tier-1 slop words: delve, comprehensive, leverage, utilize, robust, seamless
- [ ] No formulaic phrases: "I'd be happy to", "In order to", "It should be noted"
- [ ] No AI attribution in text
- [ ] Specific claims grounded with evidence (commands, numbers, filenames)
- [ ] Balanced structure (not all bullets, some prose for context)
- [ ] Active voice preferred over passive

### Vocabulary Substitutions

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| leverage | use |
| utilize | use |
| comprehensive | thorough, complete |
| robust | solid, reliable |
| facilitate | help, enable |
| streamline | simplify |

### Remediation

If PR description contains slop markers, apply `Skill(scribe:doc-generator)` principles:
1. Ground claims with specifics
2. Remove marketing language
3. Use direct statements
4. Cut unnecessary qualifiers

## Output Instructions
- Write the final PR description to the provided path.
- After writing, print the file path and show its contents.

## Notes
- Never include tool or AI attribution in the PR text.
- If new changes are required mid-process, rerun quality gates.
- This skill focuses on preparation; creating the PR (push and open) happens outside this workflow.
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

If commands like `make` or `npm` are missing, verify your environment setup against the project's `README`. For permission errors, check write access to build directories. If a step fails silently, retry the command with verbose flags (e.g., `-vv`) to inspect the error log.
