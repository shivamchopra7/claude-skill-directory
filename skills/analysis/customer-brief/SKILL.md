# Customer Brief

Deliver an audit-friendly briefing that blends current relationship signals, open work, and market context so account teams are ready for any touchpoint.

## When to Use
- Pre-call preparation for account directors, CSMs, or executive sponsors.
- Requests such as "Run a customer brief for [Account]" or "What should I know before meeting [Account]?".

## Success Criteria
- 3–5 executive bullets with sentiment and next actions.
- ≤7 recent communications with channel, parties, action, and confidence score.
- ≤7 upcoming meetings normalized to the account timezone with prep notes.
- Deliverables rendered via the `list-files` skill output block, highlighting overdue items.
- ≥3 external insights (or explicit "No new items in last 14 days") with URLs and an audit trail of sources and keywords.

## Guardrails
- **Do:** Separate internal vs external signals, annotate owners/dates, log connectors and keywords.
- **Avoid:** CRM data, gated sources, or summarizing private chats without user-provided exports.
- Default research window: last 14 days (call out exceptions). Social scanning must stay public.
- Keep every section tight—use bullets, sentence fragments ≤30 words, and remove repeated phrasing to minimize token usage.

## Fast Prep Checklist
1. Confirm account name/ID and primary timezone.
2. Verify access to tagged email folders, relevant calendars, shared drives, and trackers.
3. Align search plan (keywords, filters, priority sources) and sentiment rubric; start the audit log.

## Workflow
1. **Internal Communications** – Pull last 14 days of key emails/messages. Capture date (account TZ), channel, participants, ≤40 word summary, sentiment + confidence, and required action. State fallback if empty.
2. **Upcoming Touchpoints** – Query calendar for next meetings. Normalize times, list organizer, attendees, prep tasks, attachments, and flag critical sessions.
3. **Deliverables & Files** – Invoke `list-files` with the customer scope (folder/search query, limit ≤7, short summaries). Embed the returned `# 📁 DRIVE FILE LISTING` section as-is and note overdue statuses in follow-up bullets.
4. **Tasks/Trackers** – Import open items with owner, due date, status, blockers. If unavailable, log the gap and request updates.
5. **External Intel** – Run targeted web/news searches per plan. Capture up to five items with source, publish date, headline, and 1–2 sentence impact. Include search keywords, filters, and timestamp in audit log.
6. **Risks & Opportunities** – Distill recurring themes into Risks, Opportunities, Watchlist with owners and next steps. Highlight sentiment swings or repeated overdue work.
7. **Executive Summary & Audit Log** – Draft 3–5 bullets referencing supporting sections, maintain confident/empathetic tone, and append a concise audit log (sources, keywords, timestamps, manual overrides).

## Quality Gate
