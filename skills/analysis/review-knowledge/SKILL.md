# Review Knowledge

## Goal
Maintain knowledge base health and surface entries for review, helping the user internalize accumulated knowledge through periodic reflection.

## When to Use
- User explicitly requests a knowledge review (e.g., "review knowledge", "check knowledge base")
- At the end of a significant work phase or project milestone
- When the user wants to understand the current state of knowledge on a topic
- Periodically (e.g., weekly/monthly) to keep the knowledge base healthy

## Prerequisites
- `.claude/knowledge/entries/` directory exists with entries created by `record-knowledge`
- `.claude/knowledge/CLAUDE.md` tag registry exists

## Review Modes

Invoke with an optional argument to select a mode. If no argument is given, run **health check**.

### 1. Health Check (default)
Scan the entire knowledge base and report:

#### a. Stale Entries
- Entries older than 90 days with `status: active` — may need review for accuracy
- Detect by comparing `created:` date in frontmatter to the current date
- Report: list of entries with age, title, and tags

#### b. Orphan Entries
- Active entries with NO `- see:` links (disconnected from the knowledge graph)
- These represent isolated knowledge that may be hard to discover in future sessions
- Report: list of orphan entries with title and tags

#### c. Missing Connections
- Find pairs of active entries that share 2+ tags but have no `- see:` link between them
- These are likely related but not explicitly connected
- Report: list of suggested connections with shared tags

#### d. Tag Health
- Tags in entries that are not registered in `.claude/knowledge/CLAUDE.md`
- Tags in the registry that are not used by any entry
- Near-duplicate tags (same rules as record-knowledge similarity check)

#### e. Summary Statistics
- Total entries (active / deprecated)
- Average see links per entry
- Most connected entries (highest see link count)
- Most used tags

#### f. Unidirectional Links
- Entry A has a `- see:` link to entry B, but entry B does NOT have a `- see:` link back to entry A
- These represent broken bidirectional links that reduce discoverability from the target entry's side
- Report: list of unidirectional pairs with source entry, target entry, and direction of missing link

#### g. Broken See Links
- For each `- see:` link in entries, verify that the target file exists under `entries/`
- Resolve entries/-relative paths (e.g., `2026/03/slug.md`) and legacy filename-only paths (`slug.md`)
- Report: list of entries with broken see links, including the missing target path

#### h. Broken File References
- For each `- ref:` link pointing to a local file path (not external URLs), verify the target exists
- Resolve relative paths from the entry's location
- Report: list of entries with broken ref links

#### i. Oversized Entries
- Entries exceeding **500 KB**: report as warning (consider splitting)
- Entries exceeding **1 MB**: report as action required (split recommended)
- Entries exceeding **300 lines**: report as suggestion (may benefit from splitting)
- Report: list of oversized entries with size, line count, and tags

#### j. Synthesis Candidates
- Active entries sharing 2+ tags with 3+ entries in the cluster, and no `synthesis` entry exists for that tag combination
- `fragment` entries older than 60 days that have accumulated 2+ `see:` links (hub-forming signal)
- Report with prompt: "These entries may be ready for synthesis. Create one?"

#### k. Superseded Chain Check
- Entries with `status: superseded` must have a valid `superseded_by` path
- Check that the replacement entry exists and is `active`
- Report broken superseded chains

#### l. Missing Overview
- For each tag used by 5+ active entries, check if an `overview` type entry exists for that topic
- An overview entry is identified by `type: overview` in frontmatter
- Report: list of tags with entry count but no overview, suggesting overview creation

### 2. Topic Review (`topic:<keyword or tag>`)
Deep dive into a specific topic:

1. Search entries by tag or keyword
2. Present a structured summary of all related knowledge:
   - Key facts and decisions
   - Known pitfalls
   - Related entries and their connections
3. Ask the user reflective questions:
   - "Is this still accurate based on your current experience?"
   - "Have you encountered new pitfalls not yet recorded?"
   - "Are there entries that should be deprecated?"

### 3. Fix Mode (`fix`)
Interactively fix issues found in the health check:

1. Run health check first
2. For each issue found, take action:
   - **Orphan entries**: Search for related entries and add see links (using the same search procedure as record-knowledge step 4)
   - **Missing connections**: Add see links between suggested pairs (with user-facing notification)
   - **Unidirectional links**: Add the missing reverse `- see:` link to the target entry so both entries link to each other
   - **Broken see links**: Search `entries/` for the target filename — if found at a different path (e.g., migrated to YYYY/MM/), auto-fix the link. If not found, report for manual review
   - **Broken file references**: Report for manual review (target may need to be created or the ref removed)
   - **Oversized entries**: Propose splitting using the split procedure from `record-knowledge` — ask for confirmation before splitting
   - **Synthesis candidates**: Draft a synthesis entry template from the candidate entries — ask for user review before creating
   - **Broken superseded chains**: Report for manual review (the replacement entry may need to be created or the superseded_by path corrected)
   - **Missing overviews**: Generate an overview entry template for the user to review — do NOT auto-create, ask for confirmation first
   - **Unregistered tags**: Auto-add missing tags to the registry in `.claude/knowledge/CLAUDE.md` under the appropriate section
   - **Unused tags**: Report for manual review (do not auto-delete)
3. Report actions taken

**Tip**: Run `scripts/regenerate-tag-registry.py --write` to rebuild the tag registry from entries.
```

## Procedure

1. Glob `.claude/knowledge/entries/**/*.md` to list all entries (recursively, including YYYY/MM/ subdirectories)
2. Read each entry's YAML frontmatter (title, status, created, tags) and scan for `- see:` lines
3. Read `.claude/knowledge/CLAUDE.md` for the tag registry
4. Analyze and generate the report based on the selected mode
5. If `fix` mode: execute fixes autonomously and report what was changed
6. Output the report to the user (do NOT write it to a file unless requested)
